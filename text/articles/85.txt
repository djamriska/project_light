We really can learn something everyday. I had no idea "a*s#oles had been certified a "race".

That's a very generous spin on the most ignorantly stupid thing I've heard this year! You are totally right!

Sorry (not sorry), but there is no way to "joke" about being the "master race" when you're a white guy talking to a black person.  And even if it's a "joke," if you're too stupid to know not to make that kind of joke, then you really don't deserve to be representing the public.

Name one culture in the current world run by majority black people that wasn't/isn't being abused/economically colonized by majority white countries?

Read a book.

I'm not sure of your point. Is it that whites really *are* the master race?

the person I responded to deleted or had their comment deleted. It went something like this:
"Name one culture in the current world run by majority black people that is successful"

He looks more like a genetic mistake than a member of a "master race."

Claiming his comment was a "joke," simply proves that he is not only crass, but also socially ignorant. Neither characteristic is laudable in community leadership personnel. And frankly, it doesn't matter what "good" he's done in his community in the past. He's paid with dollars that come from the taxes of Kansas citizens. He must represent--and respect--every one of them.

That poor city planner lady could have been spared all this disrespect and drama if this commissioner had not been shielded from consequences from making racist statements in the past.

What I don't understand is the whole "You have a gap in your teeth that makes you the master race"
Could it be that he is saying that the African American woman is the master race or is it that only gap toothed people are the master race? it's odd. Perhaps the Commissioner was having an episode? Dementia sometimes flies under the radar...Maybe?

Sounds like he meant that gap teethed people are the master race.... a joke in poor taste especially with his past statements.  I think this because he pointed at himself during the exchange.

This master race goes back a way. The German philosopher Nietsche and his dear friend Wagner promoted the idea about a century ago. Both were favorites of der Fuhrer. If history would be thought properly Americans would not flab these things out as unimportant.

It's sad that so many Republicans think that they can get away with saying anything, no matter how inappropriate, simply because Trump does. I wish it was just as easy to make Trump resign.

That sort of makes Stacey Abrams one of the "master Race" doesn't it?

I had to re-read what he said, and then I got it, he basically was trying to imply that she and he had the teeth thing in common and that made them part of the master race.

Dumb at best, the use of the phrase "master race" in that context is actually somewhat out in space really.

It was intended as a really dumb joke.  That being said, to have the words 'master race' on the tip of your tongue, you hear and say it often in other contexts and it doesn't bode well for him.
