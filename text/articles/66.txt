I don't know.  Seems like it's tall enough for certain science deniers to use to refute that fake gravity thing.  Care to try?

I was under the impression a President had to be smart.  I never in all of my years saw a person this stupid, ignorant, hateful and vile in the WH.

Trump will produce one rule after another until he has crushed his adversary just as he has done his entire life with lawsuits and legal delays until everything they have is depleted. Barring Barron and Tiffany, I wish for every Trump to experience hell-on-earth before departing to hell's true location!!!

Why spare them? They'll be just like the rest of the evil spawn. Spot being so nice. They didn't spare the Obama kids. Today there's new rules to the game.

The media was very respectful of Malia and Sasha.  I recall their parents making that request before  Obama inauguration.  Hugely not a fan of anything trump, but I began this "administration" saying hands-off the spouse and minor children.  Now...Mrs. T is fair game but it's still hands-off Barron...everything  about his posture says he is a troubled kid.  Although I do find it very interesting that neither trump parent made that simple, specific direct request.

Nothing is sadder than the hypocrisy of MAGAts (who floated over here unwanted from their own countries) using the same hateful rhetoric that greeted their families when they got here.

these people (most) are looking for economic asylum and their isn't any such thing. They are welcome to get on the list of the millions who want to come here for a better life, but they need to do it lawfully. Proof? Mexico offered them opportunities to stay and it was reported that many said "no, the US is where the jobs are"

Psychopath Trump wants your fear. He wants to strangle you with it so youll grant him the power to suspend your say in what HIS government can do to the brown menace that threatens everything American. Hes doing it all for YOU, he says. 

Hes seeking the dictatorship of the USA for YOU.

So will you open your home to some of these people? Will you "job share"? Are you willing to be paid less per hour? If you answer "no" then you are not impacted by the unlawful entry by thousands of poor job seekers who have low or no job skills.

Does this idiot just lay awake at night thinking of ways to make everyones life more miserable?  I cannot think of one POSITIVE thing he has done since becoming president...everything is negative or mean or to undo something Obama did omto insult someone. God, it must be so tiring.  Give it a rest and let us enjoy Thanksgiving Mr. Grinch!

How about low unemployment rate, over all as well as for Latinos and Americans of African ancestry?  How about securing the border.  How about reduction of people on food stamps? How about getting our NATO partners to increase their spending for their own militaries to comply with what they agreed to?
Keep these folks in Mexico until their asylum has been granted.  Let Mexico feed and shelter them not U.S. taxpayers.

Trump's plan is DOA.
Asylum seekers forced to stay outside the US would no longer be under the jurisdiction of the US.
Congress specified the law clearly.
Trump is attempting to violate the law, once again.

Foreign nationals who apply for a normal visa are outside the U.S.  Seems very reasonable to me.  They fill out the paper work and submit it to U.S. authorities and when it is granted they are allowed to enter the U.S.  Most of these folks have rejected Mexico's offer of asylum and so would not be qualified for asylum here.  If we released them inside the U.S. to wait for approval we'd never find them again.

It should be fun seeing this get smacked down in the courts. If it makes it to the SC, wouldn't it be great if Roberts is the one to put this to rest?

If the federal law is clear, and Trump clearly violates the law, even the conservative justices would have to vote against Trump, if only to preserve the Supreme Court as an important body.

I dont know. But do you know who does? The court at the ports of entry. Thats how you determine the answer to your question. trump is bottlenecking the entire process. So the answer to your question is being curtailed by trump.

Is this how Trump and his venal mendacity tries to distract from his placing his personal finances over the death of an American resident? He has done this both with Putin and MBS and China even when they paid him a bribe to keep ZTE in business
