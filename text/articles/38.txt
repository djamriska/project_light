If you work for the Government handing out these things it's like getting more Customers and even more Job Security.

No, obviously youve never seen a Western Union/Check Cashing business in a migrant neighborhood. 

They send every dime they get right back to the countries they came from as fast as they get it.

Don't think our Enemies aren't following these stories to learn tips for an Invasion. Then again, we just let most of them in anyway.

While it may be true that we would profit from the people immigrating in, which I don't totally believe, it still remains that it only works when done legally. 
The thing that I see here is that when it comes to this kind of immigrant, the rule of law doesn't matter. It seems that the fact that they are willing to break the law to come in. Doesn't matter and the fact that a number continue to break even more laws, which is what criminals usually do, their status gives them a pass. Even when using a gun to do it. 
I know the percentage is supposed to be low for them committing more crimes, but if we can reduce one violent crime through forcing legal immigration it's worth it. 
By the way we didn't gas children, we gassed an invading mob. Yes because of the wind children felt the effects. Put the blame where it belongs on the mob. That really showed how peaceful they are.

Only liberals see or think allowing people to migrate (legal or illegally) will be profitable for the actual citizens of this country. They end up being supported by the government and who actually pays for that - the actual citizens.  So we won't profit but in fact cost us more.

Sorry we are not confused we just don't think with just our hearts but let logic make the decisions. Not some pie in the sky scenario.

What this article clearly states is that there's no good reason for this group to pass on asylum/jobs/housing etc. in Mexico .. and travel on to demand same in the USA. They'd clearly be better off in Mexico vs. their homeland. However, the rock throwing young men make it difficult for any country to open arms wide and roll out the welcome mat. If they're throwing rocks now - while making demands along the way - what's next? Not really interested in finding out ...

For me, this has nothing to do with weather or not immigration is useful, or even harmful.  
I'll just say it. 
Immigration did build this country. As did any country. 
Our country is built. Now it needs to settle. 
I see nothing wrong with limiting immigration visas, asylum, and citizenship, "All Around"
(Temporarily)
We need to fix our infrastructure. 
This "IS" a numbers game.

First it's whether not weather secondly show me in our history where people were allowed to just walk into our nation without signing anything nor showing any documentation as to whom they are. I have actually looked and it didn't happen anywhere but on our southern border. Ellis island has signed and documented ledgers of everyone that got off a boat there.

UPDATE: If the new leftist president of Mexico wishes to join with liberals on destroying OUR country they may want to reconsider. But then again America can help the Latino people more by sending troops into these countries and clean out the corruption causing this mess in the first place. If you have Hispanic friends let them know millions here in America have no problem solving the problems in their respected countries as to WHY their citizens are leaving on foot. I, like the majority of this country aren't going to tolerate liberals in America siding up with a bordering country's to help them dismantle our country. This will not end well.

Yes it has been fun and Trump did say Mexico would pay for the wall, not sure about the wall part, but they sure are paying. They just want to dump what they created on the US. At any point they could of blocked there southern border, and stopped it. On December 1 there new President will step into office, and have to deal with this mess. I hope for him that he has a plan in mind. This to me is a part of the NWO-agenda 21 that they are trying to push on us. It is a setup to make Trump look bad. It may get him his wall which we really do need. We have to have some control as to what goes on in this country. The US has its own problems, homeless people, vets who are living in the streets, before giving out aid to foriegners they should be taking care of there own people. This will not go away, it will just continue on, most of these people are fighters, not families of women and children. They are the cover. They want us all to open up our hearts to them, we would pay dearly for that. This is basicly a war, invasion of our country. It may get out of control, women and children get hurt in wars also. I am sure the border control and military will do what they have to to protect this country at what ever cost. I expect in the next few weeks, to have to face some new challenges. We can not allow this.

The U.S. has a lot of it's own unskilled people.  What this country needs is SKILLED immigrants.  Other countries severely limit admission of true refugees and then allow only legal immigration of SKILLED persons, so why is it so awful that the U.S. do the same?  As for Rivera's claim that these illegals are more law abiding than native born Americans, he should meet my new illegal immigrant neighbors who I've had to call the police on four times.

No, friend called police numerous times, they can't do a thing, no violation they can address. Said he has to go before the town and try to get a health violation citation. Good luck with that.

Yes. Like living in a pressure cooker, if they remain where they are and more keep coming, the lid will blow off and it will be Mexico that has to fix the problem that Mexico allowed. It's already happening.

My guess is that next week there will be some changes going on. Mexicos new President is starting on December 1, of course the old one didn't want to ruin his legacy. So Mr.President, you have your hands full from day 1. Hopefully he will have the brains to block off the southern border in a more secure way. Start by sending them home.

REFUGEE = Legal Definition* - A person who is being persecuted for reasons of Race, Religion, Nationality, Membership in a particular social group or Political Group and is outside of his/her home country. This is the law and definition since 1967. None at the border qualifies. 

ASYLUM = Same as above EXCEPT they are standing on US soil. None at the border qualifies. 

No one at the border is leaving their home country due to any of the above conditions.  

*International Law first enacted in 1951 as the Refugee Convention, amended in 1961.

Definitions Refugee;  Who is a refugee? 

Article 1 of the 1951 Convention defines a refugee as a person who is outside his/her country of nationality or habitual residence; has a well-founded fear of persecution because of his/her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion; and is unable or unwilling to avail himself/herself of the protection of that country, or to return there, for fear of persecution. 

What is protection? 

Governments are responsible for enforcing a countrys laws. When they are unable or unwilling to do so, often during a conflict or civil unrest, people whose basic human rights are threatened flee their homes, often to another country, where they may be classed as refugees and be guaranteed basic rights.

Doesn't apply here and goes out the window when they use violence to force their way into the country and attack Border Patrol personnel.  And then there's 8 U.S. Code  1182 - Inadmissible aliens.  The attacks upon both Mexico's border and ours, along with attacks on border patrol personnel justify the President invoking that law.

Dream on with that fantasy. You know, Trump can't win in the court with that simply because anyone coming in illegally cannot be denied asylum processing, so therefore, how do you think Trump can keep someone out using that section of the law.

My illegal immigrant latino neighbors have produced two kids in almost three years, adding to the others they already had.  Only the older kids speak ANY English (because of public school).  Mom and Dad both have cars and drive, but (since neither speaks English) how do they read road signs and pass the licensing driving documentation requirements?  For that matter, as non-English speaking illegal immigrants, how did they pass the mortgage requirements that I had to pass?
