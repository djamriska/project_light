If looks make you guilty then both of them qualify.

Who pays for the attorneys when it comes to defending these people?  Is it pro bono by the attorneys, or are they public defenders, or what?  Somebody please explain.

It is part of the Miranda rights. "if you do not have money to afford an attorney, one will be assigned to you."

That's only during questioning by police at the time of arrest. It does not extend last that.

If they can't afford an attorney, the court will either assign a public defender of an outside attorney who is better qualified to handle murder cases. It is very expensive to defend a person on a charge of murder, so there isn't any attorney who will do it pro bono. The tax payers do.

I couldn't agree with you more.  Neck and/or face tattoos are, imho, a sign of mental illness.

18 year old girls think they are being brave and cutting edge going out on their own.

But they are just easy targets to many people.

Especially when they hang out with meth/hard drug dealers/users who are 15 and 20 years older.

Nobody demanding that they should be set free because they're white. Maybe the libs are wrong when they endlessly scream "RACIST" at anybody they disagree with.

The guy was on probation. Has a record longer than my arm. Don't know about the woman, but I don't think that she's a stranger to jail cells either.
