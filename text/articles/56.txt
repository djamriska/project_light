only if he gets jail time, which is highly unlikely. He will plead it down, maybe be classified as a sex offender, but probably probation only and little to no jail time.

Doubtful. He'll only get a break if he turns out to be a Trump supporter.

Wow. I'm really glad they busted this guy, but the method is pretty creepy. Am I a paranoid if I acknowledge that my electronic devices are monitoring every conversation?

How long until criticizing Trump results in your devices turning you in?

You kidding. My son bought the echo, and it took me all but 30 minutes to tell him everything he was saying and doing at home.

He left the mic on on game. This wasnt his electronics spying on him. This is why I use push to talk in game and not an open mic.

I dig. But the default of a microphone should never be "transmit what I'm saying to the entire world, especially a massive corporation and/or the govt". 

Just leaving it on should not provide a backdoor for any creep who wants to spy on you.

I don't even have a mic attached to my computer. I've read 1984, a few times. I see cell phones as being the 1984 television set only portable so it can follow you and there is no corner in your home where you can hide from it as Winston was able to do even in that super-oppressive society.

It should go without saying that I also do not use cell phones. Sure, the manufacturers, who produce these phones using slave labor, have all told us that the phones are perfectly safe and won't give you brain cancer no matter how many dangerous materials make up their construction. I have never trusted or believed a slaver and I am not going to start now.

It never ceases to amaze me, the pure resolve of Huffpost commenters, to make absolutely everything and anything about Trump.

Since Trumpy always makes sure everything is about Trump, why can't we do it also?  I am sure he approves.....

Please explain the bail situation on sex assault of a minor to me when you have DNA proof. Never mind - I'm sure it involves her being "untrustworthy", and I'll never understand it in any case.

According to the Times, Fabian was only recently arrested because of the time it took to get the results of a DNA test, which linked him to the alleged assault.

Not surprisingly hufffpo does not say he's in his country illegally which he is.
