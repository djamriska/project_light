I hated my music teacher in the '70s in an LA high school. My cuz keyed his car. He thought I did it and threw a chair at me and others. It missed. He did other worst things to us but never did we strike him, curse him or throw things at him. I would never find this music teacher guilty.

This is not a boy/kid/student. This is a person who has chosen a path of defiance and disrespect. He learned this from his familial surroundings. This teacher is being dragged through the mud in the media. If the parents have any ethics or morals, they would publicly put their son in front of cameras and have him apologize.

Unfortunately, I believe the parents are looking at a possible 'payday' from the LAUSD that pays to make lawsuits go away.

Sorry but that kid more than asked for it and he's a perfect example of why corporal punishment should be allowed in the public schools again. I had it used on me and I'm no worse for wear. At the time, I deserved it and more importantly, I learned from it.

This teacher has a legal aid fund. Give to it...

The teacher should take it to a trial.No jury of his peers will find him guilty. It will also force the parents of the student to explain who taught him to be an entitled, disrespectful maggot who uses the n-word quite freely. Who also flies into a rage over a simple request to wear a uniform to band practice and leave the classroom when the teacher asked. Take note future employers, he is definitely prepared for the diverse workforce. His parents must be so proud.

In a more rational time, such as the 60s and 70s when we were kids, if you said anything close to that to a teacher you would expect some corporal injury. That awful kid might as well learn sometime that he cant run his mouth forever without consequences.

What happened to the (racist) boy? I hope he didn't return to his classes. He should be expelled or sent to another school.

I hope the little punk is charged with Elderly Abuse and Racial Hate crime for calling him the N word.

I notice you left out the part where the boy calls the teacher multiple n words, pushes him, throws a basketball at him while also challenging him to a fight!

Did you read the article? Everything you complain about was clearly mentioned in the report.

Associated Press-
A Los Angeles-area teacher captured on video punching a student who had repeatedly called him a racial slur has been charged with a misdemeanor count of corporal injury to a child.

Video posted to social media this month shows Marston Riley, who is black, repeatedly hitting the student, who returns some of the blows. Before the scuffle, the video shows the student throwing a basketball at the 64-year-old Riley and repeatedly calling him names.

City News Service reports Riley, a music teacher at Maywood Academy High School, was charged Friday. It wasn't known if he has an attorney. Arraignment is set for Jan. 4.

If I'm the judge: GUILTY. The defendant shall make payable to the court a fine in the amount of $1.

No! If he's found guilty, he'll lose his job and his credential.

I thought about that before I posted but he's 64 and can leverage this event to write a book and book speaking engagements.
