So...A black man that a police officer KNOWS has no weapon is 50 feet away from him and must be shot, but a known mass murderer who is white actually grabs a guard's weapon, and he isn't shot?

THIS is why they kneel!!!

Little bit of a stretch but, okay.  Cruz is in a lockdown and the other guards had no firearms.

Besides, with national attention on Cruz the police who are willing to shoot don't want the focus on them.

and...surprise surprise...he registered as a Republican to vote...of course, he will be denied that once he is found guilty but it won't stop the GOP from claiming he is  why they opposed Amendment 4

My guess is either 1) he did it to gain some cred so he stops getting passed around like a cheap towel, or 2) he did it to get solitary so he stops getting passed around like a cheap towel.

Or he could find a "Protector" then sag his pants low to let everyone know, and he'll be safe, like all the other weak ones.

I think sagging means "available." If he has a protector, he wouldn't be available.

I think you're right. I learned something new today.

He is just a bad, bad, no good  guy.  Not in favor of the death penalty unless the person is a continuing threat to the public, other prisoners or prison staff (example: Ted Bundy).  Cruz fits that description.

Solitary 23 hours a day like a super max situation should work and keep down behavior problems.

... of course not! Can't you see the level of melanin in his skin? It's well below the "Shoot first, ask questions later" level and much more at the level of "Use all safety precautions to not harm offender, including sacrificing some personal safety." :-(

The boy is looking for "death by cop" so he doesn't have to go through a trial and life in prison.

Unless we are ok with killing the sick, he needs to be treated in a secure facility where he cannot hurt people, but not executed.  This is severe mental illness.
