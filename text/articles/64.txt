Peoples DNA can end up in places that theyve never been.

Under a dead womans fingernails?

That's the first thing I thought, 'but under her fingernails?'  People aren't even believing straight evidence anymore.

Alternate jury, according to NY Daily News, stated that the prosecution did a poor job at proving their case to the point that the evidence anywhere d confession were suspect. All you need is reasonable doubt and there must have been some present.

Maybe we should think about some sort of professional jury system. An educated, licensed jury pool, jurors selected at random. People who understand evidence, and have nowhere to be except sitting in a jury box.   Just saying.

Um, a revolutionary war was fought to get away from a system where the people were ruled, and judged, by their betters.

Ok, but obviously it still happens all the time. Having been on a jury, I much prefer "betters".

You just described using judges to decide cases instead of juries.

Based on what we know, on its face those of us who remember the Central Park case know that confessions are far too often coerced.  But adding DNA under her nails does seem to make this a solid case for conviction.  
Please ignore the bigot Jonathan Shane on this thread.

Uh huh.  Her DNA just happened to be on the baloney sandwich he bought from a deli earlier that day.  Ive heard of that.  I wouldnt be surprised if the authorities found my DNA on one of the arrows those natives used to kill that American explorer last week.

No, this is what happens when you found and perpetuate a virulently racist society.  Those jurors aren't stupid and they're not corrupt.  They know very well that young man could have been framed. Just because they say there is DNA under the finernails doesn't make it true.  They must have seen and heard things that made them suspicious. If he's really guilty it will be discovered in the next trial. if he's not, there is no justice nor safety in locking him up.

Those jurors?  I'm betting it's probably just one.

Loud music often drives people insane and makes their DNA go places it's never been before.

Have you read the transcript Stephan?  If so then please explain to the rest of us how the defense explained the presence of the DNA.  If not, how do you know the issue was never raised?

DNA - his- in at least two places where it shouldnt be, physical evidence, confession, sure, I understand why they couldnt convict him. 

And Brock Turner got a lengthy sentence, Zimmerman was really innocent, cops NEVER shoot first and are found not guilty later, no man in the White House EVER abused a woman, and Roy Moore likes them older than him.

I would be willing to be swayed by the coerced confession defense, but his DNA under her fingernails, on her neck and phone??? Seems to me she was trying to defend herself...

Black jurors condone a "brutha" murdering a white woman? Nothing new there. Just ask OJ.

social media and the main stream news continues to tell black women through various sites that black people are framed for crimes they haven't committed, the police harass black people for no reason and black people are in prison in high number  due to a racist system, it should not be a surprise when black women are jurors where black men are defendants and they could never come to a conviction.
