It is rational to hold human smugglers and traffickers in complete contempt for their callous and wanton disregard for human life in the greedy pursuit of what is essentially blood money.

Why on earth would you spike-strip a pickup travelling at high speed with nine people in the back?

Because it might crash into other vehicles and cause even more fatalities or injuries.

To stop it. Duh!

Perhaps maybe to prevent a dangerous high-speed chase which may result in loss of INNOCENT life in a crash with another vehicle. I guess you'd be happier if the illegals were allowed to continue fleeing and crashed their truck into a crowd of innocent people or into another vehicle.

WHY chase it at high speed? 

WB on I-8 it is 14-miles from the off ramp at Old Hwy 80 to Carrizo Canyon Road. It is another 11-miles WB till the next off ramp at Ribbonwood Road, which leads to Boulevard. There is usually an ICE checkpoint setup to stop traffic just West of Ribbonwood so the pickup truck could have been easily stopped at Carrizo Canyon, Ribbonwood, or the checkpoint. There was no need to chase the truck - just setup three roadblocks and wait for it. Thus NO danger to anyone.

The driver obviously didn't want to stop and get charged. But you seem to think that the Border Patrol was driving him to speed and kill people although it turned out to be his passengers and not anyone else on the highway, same as the Highway Patrol.

Easily stopped? Seriously? Obviously the driver didn't want to stop and was focused on not getting caught.
