That manager needs to go! Thank goodness that the customer was there, and witnessed what happened. He maybe talked some sense into her!

I hope corporate McDonald's gets involved.  All she did was escalate the situation. She needs to be terminated. 

Why did she say "my store?"  Is she the owner?  Otherwise, she should have said, "our store."  Of course she could be a grandiose narcissist. First clue - my people, my store, my staff instead of our people, our store, our staff . . .

They encourage that, it displays "ownership" of responsibility.

As a manager, when you hear "gun", if the next word that comes into your head isn't "police", you shouldn't be a manager.

Of course that pitiful man would never have started the verbal altercation to begin with if he didn't have that gun as a security blanket.

Exactly that's the whole problem with people carrying guns.

Most people in the world think Americans are stupid. They are probably half right. The right half.

The darkness within shines through. They would look quite average if they didn't radiate fear and hatred of others. Sad, pathetic people but too dangerous to let walk loose.

This is the result of Trump and FOX convincing white people that people of color are to blame for all of their problems. Its disgusting propaganda that leads to this type of unnecessary violence.

Racism will never be extinguished. Some people like to hate on others. Some people like to use claims of racism as an opportunity. 

The extremes on the Right and Left love racism, they wouldn't know what to do without.

She needs to be fired.  When a gun is pulled to want the kids to be safe and you call the police.  First thing.  Manager must go

Eden Prairie is as white bread as it gets here in MN.  Sadly, its proximity to the Twin Cities doesn't ameliorate the preponderance of "stoopid".  Do your thing Twitter and smoke all of these fools out of their hidey holes.  Shine some much needed disinfecting light on these pitiful racists in our midst.

Definitely not a leader. No concern for anyones safety. Her first thought should have been call the police.

Man should be arrested by pulling the gun, the manager should be fired. She should had called the police.  Knowing the man had a gun you dont tell the kids to go outside where the man was with the gun.  McDonalds do the right thing and take care of this.  What is wrong with America?  This is disgusting what I am seeing.  This is all because of Trump and I am sick of it.  Get rid of this racist Trump and put an adult in as our president.

Trump gave them the freedom to express themselves in public and the Republicans armed them. We have no idea how many mentally ill racists are running around this country with guns.

I think we are starting to get an idea.  I have known quite a few racists in my life because most of the people I know are Republicans and I got to the point where I just walked away.  I couldn't stand it anymore.

If the roles were reversed, you can count on it that a black man who pulled out a gun would have been arrested or shot dead in the spot!

Yep.  If that manager even thought a black guy had a gun she wouldve been on the phone to 911.
