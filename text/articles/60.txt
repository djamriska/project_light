What was Ahmed thinking? Of course it's criminal to do good deeds in public while being non-white!

I sometimes think we would be safer if we just closed all our police stations.  Back the Blue? Not on  my life!

Cheaper too. Lawsuits over police violence are bankrupting every city in America, one by one. There is a great article about it in the current Harper's. Cities have gone into debt that nobody expects to be repaid for 50 years or more over a single incident. And none of these expenses have cost any police department or pension fund a single penny. But they do bleed the city dry so it can't pay for social programs, a lack of which lead to more crime which leads to more violent, out of control cops which leads to more lawsuits.

This is absurd. Being arrested for doing a good deed is absolutely preposterous.

Almost as bad as 3 months in prison for cotton candy. Think we need more/some citizen oversight on police officers.

I think we'd police ourselves better than cops do.

I often see the middle ground on these things. But nope - not with this one!

IMO, there is no such thing as a good cop, ever.  Cops in this country are of no use and should disbanded and most, including my brother who is a Philadelphia officer, should be in jail for their wanton and criminal abuse of the citizens of this country.

You might want to broaden yours. I suggest you start with Jerry Smith Jr. who was shot by Milwaukee Police in August of 2017 while unarmed.

I cannot understand why cops will not listen to people. Stop and take a moment to listen.

Every single officer here needs to be fired along with the police chief.  Is this how the chief trains this counties officers?  The folks that called the police told them they had the wrong man and the officer said he does not have to answer to them.  He sure the heck does have to answer to the people that called for help.  This my folks is Trump America.  We used to have the FBI investigate crooked racist police departments but we cannot do that now because the FBI leadership is corrupt itself.  So sad.  Trump has made America NOT great again.  We need to take our country back from these disgusting racists.

This shooting and arresting of good Samaritans is a pretty lousy trend.

Did the cop not have enough time to follow and make sure dude got home safe? CLEARLY there was enough time for useless questions and searches. Protect and serve. It all gets discombobulated in academy, apparently .

He had an illegal substance.  "Useless?" Not according to the law . His version is not the full story, I assure you, and it will come out.

There's video and they had no probable cause to search him. The arrest will be thrown out.  His skin color isnt probable cause skeeter.

No it wont. It will get dropped from the news and we will never hear all the details so that we (the public) can make an informed decision. We will just be left with our Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts of the situation. This is what news has become today. It is not just this story, it is so many stories.

America is basically a police state at this point and people of color is the chosen enemy.  So when you're in a situation with the police, just be quiet and respectful and get away from them as quickly as possible and please don't try to explain your rights to them, because for the most part they don't care, they are one the most powerful group of people in this country. They can take your freedom or your life in a flash, just typing out this comment gives me cold chills, but sadly it's the truth.

Until the police are reigned in, the only way to avoid these sorts of things is, simply, don't call the cops if you don't have to.  Deal with it yourself.  When cops show up, they feel they have to arrest somebody to show that they did something.  So if an arrest isn't warranted, don't call them.  There is a 50-50 chance that they will only make matters worse.  It is not worth the risk.

So much for "You are your brother's keeper." It's much better to not get involved. An d calling 911 means cops are not going to leave without arresting somebody.

Absolutely. Isolate, divide, and conquer. This is another step in capitalist social engineering. Make them isolated, afraid, and they'll consume.

At least 6 police officers are present at this incident, maybe more. For one guy!  Police officers need to be re-trained NOT to spend 50-60 hours per month training with their weapon, and start spending more time on Community Relations( 6 hours per month) or Conflict Management ( 6 hours per month.)But, that's not likely...

I'm taken aback by the additional police that showed up, and for what? Where was the threat? Where they in fear of those brick-hard questions being thrown at them?

More proof that local PDs need to raise the standards of qualifications, at least to the level for being a state trooper. This needs to be step one of a long process for improvement.

I would agree but we also need to pay police a lot more so we can get the cream of the crop.  Policing should be a profession like a neurologist not a low paid job.

So it's a crime to help someone while African-American?  Right?  That is the law....no, it's not the law.  Alabama cops murder an African-'American, a Maryland man is arrested by doing a good deed.  America is a racist country led by a fat, white racist.

And, dont forget the black nightclub security guard, who was recently murdered by police while he was saving lives by detaining a would-be mass murderer!

We would do better to invest in more enlightened training for our law enforcement rather than paying out the lawsuits that spring from poorly executed decisions.
