Presidents should NEVER be allowed to pardon people who are traitors against our country. That alone makes them guilty too, and they should not only be removed from office, but also tried for it.

In your formulation of this statute, wouldn't there first have to be a jury finding that the individual receiving the pardon has in fact been convicted of Treason?

Tom Sutpen, no, the pardon should be given ONLY for specific offenses, not for anything and everything (as in Ford's pardon of Nixon), and what Jeffrey Brass is saying is that any accusation of treason may not be "rendered moot" by a pardon. If a president cannot pardon for acts of treason, then any criminal process accusing someone of that act cannot be derailed by a pardon. Pretty simple.

pres can only pardon for federal crimes, not state...my guess, manafort has numerous state issues and probably will never see light outside prison...he's lying to keep putin from giving him a poison cocktail...

And since Manafort was working on behalf of Trump's campaign, does that mean *45  should be rotting beside him? Go ahead,  Meghan, share your views on that awkward point.

If he is going to rot in hell Or in prison, I hope he takes the Trump crime family with him.  

If Trump thinks it is getting HOT now, wait tell Jr. gets indicted and then his mob family loses in court over their fraudulent charities.  All I want for the holidays are more indictments against Trump Kushner, Stone, Corsi and others who have helped this crime syndicate sell our country to Russia and Saudi Arabia for their own personal gain.   

Impeach, imprison and lock them all up for eternity.  I hope they lose every dime to attorneys and that their properties get sold in auctions.

It took Trump bad mouthing her father to get her to see what a low life he really is? The rest of us recognized that well before he invaded the WH.

Meghan McCain is so damned phoney. She should take that "rot in hell" comment and give it to Trump and the GOP for disrespecting her father.

Manafort is a life long schist-er who took his operation off shore to maximize profits and avoid onshore scrutiny. He has made 2 critical mistakes.
He got in bed with a sort off shore people who make the Mafia look like nice guys.
He brought his song and dance back to America and those not so nice off shore guys will not permit him to to save his virginity by telling the truth.
Rot in jail is good for me.

McCain is right and the panelist who brought up the whole question of presidential pardon power is also right. Some of the pardons that Trump has already made don't have any merit, to me (i.e. Scooter Libby). I was a supporter of both Clintons but I was more bothered by Bill Clinton's pardon of fugitive financier Mark Rich than I was of the Lewinsky matter (although that bothered me too). And don't get me started on Gerald Ford's pardon of Nixon. To this day, I'm still angered about that. If Trump gets to run in 2020, and he hasn't pardoned Manafort yet, the Dem candidate should run ads about that possibility. Trump could do that on his way out the door (in Jan 2021) or he might do that if he sees that he's not going to last that long. It would be an outrage either way (one of many involving Trump).

"McCain said Manafort should never have been involved in a presidential campaign  something with which her father, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), apparently agreed."

Republicans like McCain attempt to pass themselves off as honest and decent by throwing someone like Manafort under the bus, yet conveniently ignoring the far bigger "evildoers" in their midst. If McCain wan'ts to cleanse the party symbolically by denouncing Manafort, she has to be consistent and go ahead and declare the same goes as far as Trump is concerned. He ALSO should never have been involved in a presidential campaign. Because Republicans always put retaining power ahead of principle and the interests of the Nation, you backed a manifestly unfit person for president, and this Nation will be paying for that sin for decade, if we indeed EVER recover from this.

Pence has kept his hands clean to be able to pardon the whole trump crime organization.
The only way they would ever go to jail is for trump to be unseated in 2020, then go after him and his gang. Any convictions before that will just be pardoned.

Can you remind us of all the traitors who have worked so closely with Putin to overthrow duly elected people. Tax frauds too.
