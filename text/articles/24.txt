How many "white" American's have been killed in Mexico in the last few years?  Not too many.  Mexico is dangerous for sure.  But so are many cities in the United States.

All 3 lost their cell phones?
That is unlikely, unless you were robbed or voluntarily handed them over for some reason.
They were probably involved in something sketchy, something you wouldn't mention to your mom.

Tijuana has always been a dangerous place. Mexico in general now is not safe. I used to like going there off the cruise ships. Cancun used to be a great place to vacation....Would not do that anymore! These teens should have never been there in the first place. Very Sad.

This is true, there are areas of Mexico not safe.  But to judge an entire country as not safe, is far from the truth - check your FACTS!   Cancun is safer than South Chicago, and many other cities in the USA. Puerta Vallarta, Cabo, and other destinations in Mexico are  safe - do they  have their share of crime, yes, just as we do in the USA.   Border towns have always been a place one should consider venturing into knowing crime tends to be higher in these towns. Known fact SD area Teens(many underage) have been venturing to Tijuana for many decades, because they can drink at age 18 (you have the $$$, you will get served whatever you want), and freely get drugs.  How many of these killings to American youths have occurred in the many decades - very few. This one I believe is drug related by these youths.   Since It appears you are from Brooklyn, if true, I can guarantee you there are areas in NYC one would not venture into because of safety concerns.  Avoid getting caught up in the mass hysteria of fear when you venture outside the USA.  Collect you FACTS and check the State Department destination sites for the latest updates on travel safety details.

I knew some people years ago who traveled down there on motorcycles and motorhomes. One of them died. It took forever to get his body home, and they had to grease the palms of many people to do it. It took many more months to get his bike back, and cost several thousand dollars.

You believe drugs were involved? 
Why? No drugs or other evidence was found.

That was caused by them of ignoring travel warning of government. But Mexican killers should be handled in the same way.

With the No Travel Advisory for numerous states in Mexico, and the recent murder of that Colorado Grad student in Cancun. and the soaring murder rate there, why would you go at all?

White Americans are generally safe.  Some get involved with stupid sh!t down there and get killed.  Some are murdered, yes.  But try walking into certain areas of Chicago or Miami or even DC and see what happens.

Why not? The majority of terrorists acts are committed by white men. El Paso, full of immigrants, is one of the safest cities in the US. Open borders, tougher laws on immigrants and whites.

Juarez, saw the murders of hundreds of women crossing to El Paso,  Texas for many years UNSOLVED. So your logic is garbage

Mexico has one of the highest murder rates in the world and that's not including the 200,000 plus people that have just disappeared or the corpses they find that can't be ID'd.  Most murders also end with no conviction.

Thats exactly why families are trying to come here for asylum. Sorry for your loss. God bless your brother, you and your family.

These families refuse to fight corruption in their home country. Do you think they'll fight for us? Let them have the chance. An Honorable discharge gets citizenship. But only directly into service upon arrival. Worked for the Irish in '63

Not only should we seal off the border with Mexico, we need to plant mines on the border like the border between north and south Korea. Mexico is going the way of all other Central America countries.

This is what families are trying to get away from and seeking asylum. Think about that? The cartels arent trying to come here! Its the victims trying to get away! The terrorists here are white men. Thats who we should be afraid of.
