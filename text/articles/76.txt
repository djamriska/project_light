Australia should be looked upon as the model for how to handle gun control in the United States.

Yes, if the US did not have the 2nd Amendment and wanted forced buybacks of firearms.

This is something that cannot occur in our community.

Sorry, sir, but no community in America can be excluded from such occurrences. It's the price you pay for allowing guns. It's like car ownership, the price you pay is car accidents. Do people really think that there are no consequences. Shame, shame.

Now the NRAs position will remain:
Its too soon to talk about gun violence. 
Therere arent enough good guys with guns.
Guns dont kill people, people kill people.
The second amendment gives the right for US citizens to bear arms (with no regard for the militia clause).
The right to bear arms exceeds all other rights like the right of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
The right to bear arms shall not be infringed (try to buy a machine gun, a SAM, a napalm bomb, an armed hand gernade, etc).
