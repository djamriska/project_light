When a grown man, with help from others, cannot subdue a 14 year old girl without beating her, we have come to a sad point as a society.   Force used to be a last resort.  Now it appears to be the first choice.  How will young folks learn to respect the police, if the police are beating them at 14 years old?

That would be the role of the justice system in a democratic society. There's no good reason to body slam these kids.  You got plenty of cops there, why not just slap the cuffs on them, eh? This just looks like a symptom of a country that's lost it's identity.

Laying on the ground with your arms and hands beneath you and a full grown man kneeling on your back, makes calling her resisting arrest a real stretch. Punching totally unnecessary. Sometimes restraining someone requires patience, to let them realize that struggling will not help, and give them a chance to calm themselves. There is no immediate danger, no imminent threat, no "another" emergency to attend to, wait awhile gibe a person a chance to realize resistance is futile, and most importantly you aren't going to hurt them. This super aggressive, escalating demand for immediate compliance and threatening physical harm is bad policing because it doesn't work and it isn't how humans are suppose to act even toward other humans misbehaving.

Your approach is so reasonable and that is apparently not part of police culture.

Then become the police. Police are only a reflection of the communities from which they are drawn and recruited.

These fools can't even arrest a 14 year old girl without resorting to corporal punishment.

I've made thousands of arrests, Rich, and they didn't do anything wrong.  Anybody can keep their hands apart so that officers can't handcuff them, so officers are forced to use force to get hands behind the back.  This was one of those times.  But, hey, I'm sure you could do better having never, ever handcuffed anybody.  Right?!?!

It's obvious that American police officers across the country need better training in the use of force and de-escalation. They also need a much better screening process for officer candidates.

Just because a person is resisting do not give the cops the right to beat up anyone...they do not have the right to inflict punishment because they simply believe someone committed a crime...and because you feel this way this is why thing are the way they are,.....that's why many cops will be shot first while attempting to arrest people...dont nobody got time for cops thinking they judge jury and prosecution....FUGG what you think!

Actually yes, if a person is resisting the cop has every right to physically strike them.  It amazes me how few people seem to realize this.

This is why we voted for Trump to give handcuffed minority female teens a beat down. Anything goes with that great president Donald Trump,  he is a super smart man with super smart kids and a fantastic immigrant wife. Most of all he is forgiving, Look how he has forgiven the Saudis for 911. He is willing to send them Billions in arms so they wont have to use planes next time. Good for you Mr President keep showing the critics wrong.

They were trying to cuff her but the combination of one female and one male cop could not get her to submit, they did what had to be done. This would have happened with a white kid also but that would not make the news now would it?

The cop needs to be fired for excessive force & the kid needs to go to Juvie for trespass & assault.

I didn't see anything about trespassing, and the assault was not visible.  Maybe the trespassing can be viewed as the officer thought it was their mall, as it is known when an officer enters the wrong apartment and then shoot someone when they make a mistake.  BTW, did they ever say who called, was it a white woman aka Mall Mary?

yes she was trespassing it says so in the article.  She was banned from the mall by security from harassing customers and pushing a 5 year old to the ground.  Still she returned to the mall and continued harassing people.  I'm sure you'd love to blame this on a white woman calling 911 but sometimes kids are out of control and need to be punished.  Their parents should be punished as well.

I understand that the mother of the 5 year old baby that was assaulted by this brat called the police. I notice that you conveniently over look that assault. You can call her Mall Mary in your attempt to be clever and denigrate the white race if you like and that is more on you than the 5 year olds mother. Makes you racist don't it Peggy?

When did we have so many rabid dogs in our police force?  I will admit that parenting also plays a role here.  Although when you look at how the GOP has made it easy for the rich to gut the middle class, the last thing a parent working 2 jobs to make ends meet wants to do is discipline their kid.  Flat out greed is tearing our country apart.  The GOP is perfectly ok with this.

What these kids need is a good whipping by their parents.  Oh, can't do that anymore.

This thing police have of meting out the first round of Justice (a cop beat down) as they arrest someone, or even after they are subdued, has GOT TO STOP! They arent paid or authorized to do that. Due process and the Courts are for that.

There should be a law that whenever a cop does that, the suspect goes free - and its a demerit on the officer. That will stop this process dead in its tracks!

Better to remain silent and have people think you are a fool than to open it up and remove all doubt...  There should be a law against people thieving oxygen too but I see you're still breathing!

You should take your own advice.  The last time I checked police were public servants who get paid to serve the public.
