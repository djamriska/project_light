Agreed that the puck to his head did some (long term) damage....

Yeah - all those people in classrooms are going to stand up and throw hockey pucks, and hope they aren't one of the unlucky ones that the shooter blindly points at.  Get real.

Or better yet. Tell the shooter as he or she enters the room. Wait please, I need to retrieve our bucket of rocks from the locked closet so we can throw at you and distract you.

Bring hockey pucks to a gunfight.  How do progressives survive childhood?

It's probably just a roundabout way of trying to bring in more guns at schools. First they suggest something inept, like pucks, and when of course it does nothing, they can say they tried, but all they have left to do is arm teachers more often.

Instructing unarmed people to stand and fight shooter(s) has got to be one of the stupidest ideas  that has yet been proposed as a policy to handle these horrible daily events.  The only dumber idea is, of course, the NRA's theory that a bucket full of loaded guns should be placed in all common areas of a school on the theory that creating hundreds of extra school shootings might cut down on the dozens of current school shootings despite the ample evidence that gun owners and armed guards haven't stopped, or even reduced the carnage of, a single gun massacre to date...

Are these examples of the people that are supposed to be making our children more intelligent? We are doomed as a species.

I am sure most of the these snowflakes have an arm like jello anyways. Chances high a rock or puck would never reach the distance to the target.

Have you ever noticed that the snowflakes always seem like they're throwing left handed?  Why are they all so uncoordinated?

Terrible idea.  They might miss and hurt a bystander.  Best bet is to drop, curl into a fetal position and await ur fate.

Finally, after years of trashing the NRA, we can go after the NHL. What's next, bring hockey sticks to class? Or goalie pads?
