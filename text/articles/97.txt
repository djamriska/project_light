He shouldnt be treated like everyone else, he should be treated more harshly. Abusing someone is bad enough, but abusing someone when you are trusted and tasked with protecting them is beyond inexcusable.

It's actually pretty rare to go to jail without being charged with something.  In fact, they are setting themselves up for a lawsuit by doing so.

"Before moving to the sex crimes unit, Kimball was accused in 2009 of grabbing a womans hand and trying to make her touch his genitals while he was on duty."

So they figure what?  This guy has an obvious interest in sex crimes, so he's a perfect fit?

They can't release the photos of the victim because she's a minor.  They won't release the photos of the perp because he's a cop.  They get extralegal protections and immediate legal representation...privileges not available to normal people.

It's so simple, people: stop believing those in authority or uniforms are conferred some innate goodness. In fact, we should put preventive systems in place, ASSUMING such situations will arise.

"....the District Attorneys Office will not give Kimball any special treatment because he is a police officer...."  <<<   The person who made this statement is a bald-headed liar.     Anyone ELSE arrested for Rape,   does not get "Administrative Leave,  with pay",  while awaiting trial.   He's either a Perp,  or he's not.    If enough evidence and testimony exists to justify an arrest warrant,   he should suffer the same way anyone else does....income deprivation,  while awaiting trial.    For us Small Fry out here,   that means you almost immediately CAN'T AFFORD a good defense lawyer.    Then,  the D.A. pressures you into a Plea Deal.    That's how the cookie crumbles,  for most of us.

If Kimball had watched some of the Law & Order episodes over the past twenty years, he would have been able to predict his future in a penitentiary.

The perp was from Ventura; change that headline or add the word "County".  The city of Los Angeles is an unfair target here.

Not understanding why he is suspended WITH pay while being held on 2 million dollars bail.  That seems like an oxymoron.  Frightening also that he has been on the force for another 12 months before these charges were brought against him; I would imagine that there are other victims...you don't do something like this just once.

I'm not trying to stick up for cops  or this cop, but I am trying to comment on our bail system:

That bail ($2 million), without even being charged is clearly meant to keep him in jail.  It's worth noting, that if they haven't charged him (much less indicted him) there's a good chance they won't.  
Bail isn't supposed to be used to keep people in jail before a trail is held to determine if they are guilty.  It's just supposed to help assure their appearance in court.  On paper, a cop with a long service record, a home and family is an excellent candidate for a very low bail.  Especially since he can pay for the whole ankle monitor thing.

They abuse the bail system like this for two reasons:
1- To be cruel and abusive
2- To help increase their conviction rate tremendously.  People in jail are  much less able to defend themselves, especially if they aren't wealthy as most people lose their job (and thus any chance of having an attorney) when they are jailed.  Also you can't gather evidence, investigate, pay damages etc while you are in jail.  Often in jail you can't even read what the law is that you are accused of breaking, much less research case historys of others that went to trial for the same and/or related cases.

I agree with you about our bail system, but bail isn't set just to make sure someone shows up for court.  it's also set high---or bail isn't given at all-- if someone is deemed a "threat to society", if they committed a violent crime,  

Non-violent crimes, such as drug crimes, are a different story

I WOULD consider this guy a threat to society.    Rape is violent crime plus the victim has a right to feel safe, knowing he's in jail and not back out onto the street where he could find her and threaten her and her family.

Yes, it is frequently set high for people that are allegedly dangerous.  the problem with that is twofold:
1 - It's unconstitutional and thus anyone (even if they are dangerous) with a paid lawyer can get bail except in capital cases.
2- Those who aren't dangerous and don't have a a lawyer often stay in jail (see above) because the prosecutor says they are in an effort to win more cases.

Sounds like you didn't even bother reading what I wrote.  And, I see by another comment you make that your sole concern in this case is for the detective.

And, btw, I know a little bit about criminal law.  I'm a retired law enforcement officer and I have a JD degree.

What do you have apart from a concern for this cop?

The United States needs some Chinese justice, for dirt bags like Kimball, and every other scum bag in the District of Criminals and Wall Street....A bullet in the back of the head. A clear message to the next public servant or CEO, to not violate the trust of the American people.
