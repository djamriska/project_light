Another "virtuous" white woman following in the footsteps of the one who got Emmitt Till killed and the long line of passive aggressive white bigots like BBQ Becky

I agree. Still horrible to think about what Democrats did to Emmitt Till and now they're trying to do it to this boy! And all black boys accused by burning the presumption of innocence and due process at the stake.

If that women didn't know the difference between having her back end  grabbed and a backpack hitting it she sure is deeply in trouble.  By the looks of her one would think she would welcome any kind of attention.

Did any one else seethe sexual pelvis thrusts she made to the child? She should be arrested for attempted sexual assault of a child.  Why is she calling him young man? He is a BOY/CHILD. It bothers me that white folkscall our children adults.

That's a big word! Smart kid. His mother raised him right based on what I've seen.

Teresa Klein is just another Racist.  I am sure she can find a place on Fox News or amongst White Evangelicals and Conservatives.

Would she have felt so "threatened" if a white boy brushed past her in a grocery store? I think not

Every woman deserves to be believed until there is evidence that she is wrong.  Something DID brush up against her backside.  It's her racism that allowed her to believe that it was a 9-year old black boy.

Very big of them to accept her apology but I doubt  her apology was very sincere or that she would have even apologized in the first place if there was no video footage. And for her to be screaming on the phone that she had been sexually assaulted by a child?! She seemed to have been looking for a reason for a confrontation that day and that poor kid got caught in her crosshairs. SMH

Yeah.  Being a 9 year old who did nothing wrong accused of sexual assault.  That would do a number on anyones psyche.

The one thing all these "Beckys," and "Pattys" and "Carolines" have in common is they're all SOOOO ugly!

They must have sad, depressing lives.

I'm impressed by Jeremiah's vocabulary.  I can hardly imagine a young kid even knowing the word "humiliated."
I'll bet he is a good student and can even read.  Where I live, kids don't take their eyes off their phones long enough to learn.

Do you really think that woman would have reacted the same if the boy had been white?

She was very much in the wrong.  But does the media have to focus on it just to make sure we get a little more racism in our day?  Think of if we ignored stupid stories like this and how people would stop constantly thinking about race or gender.  Worry about the kind of people out there not their color..

If he had been a little white boy, do you think that woman would have reacted the same way?

Yes, she didn't know WHO "grabbed" her....she was instantly furious (and wrong).

It's ridiculous to try and make this particular instance racial.

Why is it so hard for you to believe it's not? Black children, especially black boys are never seen in the same light as white children. Don't believe me ask Tamir Rice. Oh that's right you can't because he was murdered by an overzealous COP.

At least this woman had the decency to apologize for a false accusation, which is certainly more than Ford did.

Why should Dr. Ford apologize? I can see from your comment that you are on of those Trumpian who believes Trump/Kavanaugh's line. Be informed, my friend, that for every one of you there are thousands of us who believe Dr. Ford 100%.

It should  not be a matter of me or you for that matter "believing" anything.  That is the point.  She chose to make the claim.  She chose to come forward.  She chose to testify.  In the end she could not prove a single solitary fact other than she told other people about it, which is nothing more than hearsay evidence.  My problem with all of it is that we have a system in our country that provides that people are innocent until proven guilty.  It works.  She tried - with the help of the Democrats- to bypass the system and go straight to guilty until proven innocent.

Innocent until proven guilty also applies to accusations of lying. Do you have evidence that Dr. Ford's testimony was a lie?

There should be better ways to "toughen the skin". Not like this. But, I don't doubt that he'll come out stronger from this.
