Honestly, it will take humanity to value humanity... and that seems to be a hard sell. Not only in the obvious manner--valuing black lives--but in people believing confidently in THEIR capacity to do the right thing. People have a fundamental lack of faith. They are all over CLAIMING they support the troops, but when it comes to standing for the fundamentals of the Constitution... well that's different. The same is true of the multitude of "Christians" who are more than willing to hold up pictures of aborted fetuses for their faith, but TURN THE OTHER CHEEK? nah, can't have that. These racist bigots do not believe in the fundamental foundation of what they claim to believe. Why? They don't believe in themselves, their capacity to resist, their capacity of staunchly walk their talk. Heck, many of these people have not even actually read the premises of Jesus or the principles of the Constitution. They blather and brae, but bellicose bedlam is all they honestly offer. This is why we must judge by the fruits of their spirit. A good tree does not bear bad fruit nor does a bad tree bear good. Get honest America.

Unfortunately the media doesn't like the whole "complete honesty" thing one either side of the fence.  Bad for ratings.

The Captain is still very involved with members of the force. We are not outnumbered Jerry, we are in almost every town. Any uprising can be put down with brutal force if given the word.

Black lives will matter in America when the judicial system starts to punish those who take our lives and takes money out of the pockets of the people who employ the killers.

Hard to get excited about BLM when they do nothing at all about black on black murder.   That is much more of a problem but they will not even acknowledge it.

Your racist comment is a fallacy pushed by conservatives that blame the victims. You should be ashamed of such an insidious stance, but I understand where your lack of capacity is derived.

Why are facts that you do not like racist?  Why does 13% of the population commit 50% of all murders?  those are facts.

Convicting cops for killing black men who pose to threat.  If the justice system works, police behavior will change.

I'm white, I'm so sorry that black people have to be treated this way.  I don't understand it.   It's completely awful.  Why should people be defined by the color of their skin, they are people, we are all people.

They shouldn't be but they are. Racism is alive and well in America. For black lives to matter racism needs to go away. Not sure that will ever be the case in America.

It can stop being the focus of our media.  Might not make it go away but sure would cut down on the amount when they know it isn't going to get anyone on the news if the commit some crime.  If we stopped reporting on it so much and focused on positive things people would follow that. The media controls the stories.

A perfect summerize of my thought to this day : "What has become clear in this shooting and every other shooting since the initiation of the movement in 2013 is that no amount of death changes the collective (majority white) view of black people as disposable objects."
The total lack of empathy toward the "disposification" of black bodies is beyond appaling .

The bigots keep bringing up Black crime statistics, but those statistics show that White people commit the most violent crime at almost 70%.

For me I would like to see activists get off the preaching about privilege and systemic root causes and checking ones bias and all that jazz and get to actual solutions which is what I hope activists would be doing. Police reform requires independent civilian review of all police incidents involving violence and that review board needs teeth. Law needs to be reformed so police cannot lie to the citizenry in the same way we cannot lie to them. Make a false statement by police to the people a crime, if the police union says such and such happened and then a tape comes out showing that was a lie, they got to jail. Law means nothing if it is not fairly imposed on all. 

Black people have gotten a bad deal here, there is no question.

But police brutality effects people of all color, especially in the lower incomes. I have known a lot of people abused and beaten by police, it is not uncommon, white is not some shield they respect. 
Get the brutality, the cruelty and the fraud out of policing, make community safety and service more important then arrest stats when looking at promotions. Teach police to depend the civil rights of it's citizens, to be the protectors of those rights that should be drilled into them. Make them the stewards of law, most have little understanding of law as a concept and a system of fairness, they only see it as a cudgel.

Yes, the problem is that it is not just not seen as a problem but the people that cite it as a problem are seen as problems themselves. Black Lives Matter, Colin Kaepernick are demonized like there are much more important matters to pay attention to. I agree that living while black is not easy in this democratic country of ours.
