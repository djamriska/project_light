Its one thing to call the police. Its another for them to arrive and remove the student.  The police are just as much at fault for obliging this ridiculous professor.

You have to remember that the police forces are an outgrowth of the slave militias whose duty was to "put black people in their place, period, no matter what the circumstances".

If the student was white??

What TF did that instructor think she was going to prove by going to that ludicrous, and extremely cruel, extreme? I sure hope she isnt tenured, and therefore nearly impossible to get rid of. The student should file a grievance, which will be backed up by the videos-recorded on the same phones that infuriated the instructor. All this bad press should motivate administrators to give Professor Peevish her two week notice, effective immediately.

Two weeks notice applies when someone quits.  Firings usually take the length of time needed for security to escort the person off the premises.  Personal effect will be boxed and sent to the person's residence.

She needs to be fired. By her actions, shes taught those students what ails this country, and she has nothing else to teach them that students want to listen to.

Tenured faculty can be fired for a variety of things including harassment, which this is.

What is it with these racist White people? All the professor had to do was ask the student  "to kindly put down your feet, this is a classroom not the student lounge". Makes me wonder how many legitimate 911 calls were missed due to this ignorance by a professor?

Maybe she did and was ignored. Sounds like she has control problems

Exactly. There are so many ways this could have been handled, beginning with the instructor taking stock of whether this needed to interrupt instruction. She could have opted to talk to the student individually after class or during a break. Strategically calling in LE for such minor infractions makes the instructor appear petty and incompetent. Not a good look for someone aiming to have an impact on student learning.

I see white people put their feet up in chairs all the time.

Cultural Differences Notation: In my day, which has not elapsed, properly reared children of the Black community knew better than to place their feet on any furniture, most especially where others would be looking to sit. It was assumed a child neither wanted or needed feet found placed on furniture. Such behavior was to be reserved for white people, consistent with their rude and disrespectful way at that time.

Each one of these incidents, along with the cop shootings of unarmed black men and boys, cause black people to hate whites more and more, to the point that the races will probably never come together. But Im sure that pleases the powers that be that exploit us both.

What narrow-minded person is going to "hate" another race based on poorly reported stories like this? Are you stereotyping just a little?

You do realize this site is the same as FN and Breitbart just leaning the other way, right? Take an honest look around at the comments and you will see the vile from the left. It's ok and I don't care that people do it, just don't act like only one side is guilty of it.

The problem is, the police respond and give the caller the satisfaction of at least a harrassment of the offending 'undesirable'.

If she has to call the police to deal with what she percieves as a minor discipline problem, then she's probably in the wrong line of work.

Couldn't really see the inciting incident on the video, but unless she had Wile E. Coyote dynamite sticks between her toes, the instructor's actions seem ridiculous (if not racist). What I found most disturbing about the video, however, was all of her fellow students barely looking up, much less protesting, the introduction of police into the situation. Way to go, kids! Keep checking your FaceBook.

Pep Larson - Seriously. I would have waited until the class resumed and gotten up and walked out - with my back to the instructor for as long as possible. Ironically, I just finished reading the article on Pelosi and how the younger people elected to Congress want to take over the leadership role. Nice start.

Coming in deciding that you are taking over is a problem and beyond disrespectful. Do you abide that in your involvements. Most of humanity balks at such a concept.

This is as ridiculous as the barbecuing-while-black incident of last summer. Were the student's feet depriving someone of a seat? There appears to be enough room in the lecture hall. Why have some people decided to waste the police's time to enforce poor etiquette?  So the professor is the one who did the actual disrupting of class. SMH!

I am most upset how the students in that class sat on their hands as this violation of civil rights took place right in front of them. They should have been vocal in protest and should have all left the class with that woman

At least one had the good sense to record the incident and post it to the public. That was his form of protest and it worked!

I'm going to call her Academic Anita, the latest in a wave of neurotic white women who have called the cops on innocent black people. In keeping with the absurdity of it all, I wonder if the police asked the chair if it would like to press charges?

Why isn't this a crime?

And I'm not talking about the student who put her feet up on the back of the chair, either.

Seriously.  They need to start jailing these white people who call police for things like this.

Youre absolutely correct. What crime did she report, and why did they even respond?
If she reported that the student was being aggressive in threatening manner, then she should be charged with, false reporting.
 The teachers behavior in itself is a crime, an enormous waste of taxpayers dollars, and look how it has ended up traumatizing not only the student, but her peers, and the image of the entire university. There will be an expensive investigation, possibly litigation costing tens of thousands of dollars. 
The price of racism is terribly high, not only in dollars, but the anguish and death toll. well, that speaks for itself.

And I can't help but wonder if they were disappointed that she cooperated and didn't give them the opportunity to put their foot on her neck.

Their behavior on arrival may be described as complicit, but showing up when someone calls isn't. 

And seriously, do you think that this woman called and said, "I need an officer sent out, there's a student propping her feet up in a chair"? Of course not. People call and complain about something/someone being suspicious, or disruptive, causing a disturbance, blah blah blah. A dispatcher who says, "Yeah, I think you're full of it" and ignores the call is going to be unemployed, because at the end of the day, the person answering the phone can't actually see what's going on.

The professor needs to have her credentials challenged.  She's 1/2 step away from a major breakdown.

And not one student had the courage to stand and follow this girl out of the room.  Power prevailed and they were all taught the wrong lesson.

Crying again, though I am old and crusty. 

There is no protection to be had, for your existence is your vulnerability. This should not be. Nor can this be a spirit crushing experience. 

So prepare to be calm and collected. Prepare to activate immediate video documentation. Prepare to choose not to clown so the absurdity of your experience will not be obscured.

And prepare to be embraced by right thinking people of every persuasion and ethnic grouping. The world is on your side.
