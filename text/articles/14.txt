An 46 year old Honduran man arrested Saturday near the San Ysidro border crossing was a convicted murderer. He was released four months ago from a Honduran prison and had been traveling with the caravan.

This is news? "One of the men was from Honduras and the other from El Salvador, according to the U.S. attorneys office, which alleged that one man elbowed an agent and the other tried unsuccessfully to punch another agent." Worse stuff happens on the red line every day without even a nod.

The extreme right Tells us that they are all rapists and criminals. Tomny, do these rapist and criminals hire all those women and children as human shields? Maybe Soros funds it all an evil, Zionist, UN, New World order conspiracy to take your freedom away and make you eat tacos??!

What is the Board Patrol? Surfboards perhaps.

Well, they finally corrected the headline to say Border Patrol. I liked the other version much better.
