Seems like when a person reaches a certain threshold of power the only way for them to be held accountable is through a sniper's scope.

I think it is time the victims family of these crimes sue the officials that made these sanctuary laws and do enforce detainers.

I am guessing that there is a good lawsuit here. Releasing someone who is not in the US legally is a crime.

Actually, ICE screwed up, they failed to serve a judicial warrant.

There was no "screw up". An arrest warrant is not needed for someone that has already been arrested. He was released from the custody of the Middlesex County Jail after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainer was ignored.

ICE places detainers on aliens who have been arrested on local criminal charges and for whom ICE possesses probable cause to believe that they are removable from the United States, so that ICE can take custody of the alien when he or she is released from local custody. When law enforcement agencies fail to honor immigration detainers and release serious criminal offenders, it undermines ICEs ability to protect public safety and carry out its mission.

The Supreme Court has emphasized that detaining individuals solely to verify their immigration status would raise constitutional concerns. But that is precisely what ICE asks local agencies to do when it issues ICE detainers. Continuing to detain a person after they are eligible for release, based purely on an ICE detainer issued without probable cause that the person is actually deportable, is a clear violation of the Fourth Amendment. 
 
An ICE detainer is not a warrant. A genuine criminal warrant must be issued by a judge and supported by a determination of probable cause. In contrast, ICE detainer is issued by an ICE officer, not a judge, and is frequently issued simply because ICE has initiated an investigation into a persons status. An ICE detainer request is just that: a request. There is no legal requirement for a LEA (law enforcement agency) to comply. 

January 2017 - In Mercado v. Dallas County, 6 multiple plaintiffs sued for being denied bail because of ICE detainers and being detained after when they should have been released. The Northern District of Texas held that Dallas could be held liable for unlawful detention, because even if ICE detainers claim to be based on probable cause of deportability, that is not probable cause of a crime. The court held that to make an arrest, Texas law enforcement agencies must comply with the Fourth Amendment, which requires probable cause of a criminal offense, not a civil immigration offense.

2018  In Cisneros v. Elder, 9, plaintiffs Cisnero and Rodriguez attempted to post bond from El Paso County Sheriffs Office, but the sheriffs office refused to release them because they were subject to ICE detainers.  The District Court of Colorado, El Paso County, determined that Colorado law does not grant the sheriffs office authority to hold plaintiffs after they have posted bond, completed their sentences, or otherwise resolved their criminal cases on the basis of an ICE detainer or administrative warrant. The court held that an ICE detainer or ICE administrative warrant does not constitute a warrant under Colorado law. In order to make a warrantless arrest in Colorado, an officer must have probable cause to believe that a crime was committed, but an ICE detainer or administrative warrant does not provide probable cause to believe that a criminal offense was committed.

Sounds like Fox is going Alt-Right, yet again.

The BOTTOM LINE is that ANYONE could have sold her the ammunition she needed to kill those people, but, just this ONE TIME, the person happened to be someone with a few blemishes in his documentation.

...and so that turns into a HATE ALL IMMIGRANTS article.

Hopefully we win in 2020, open the borders, and FINALLY get to show Americans that not all immigrants are killers - some are actually fairly honest people.  That will TEACH THEM A LESSON.

If you and others like you "win", your open borders would destroy this nation and result in irreparable harm to the people who BUILT this nation. It only takes a few--homicidal, drug-dealing, cartel-owned  and criminal-culture based ppl. And IF you're old enough to have children, how would you feel if ONE illegal alien brought back a childhood disease, eradicated in the U.S. but NOT in third-world countries, and that disease harmed or killed YOUR child? You'd want the borders closed then-but it'd be too late.

Agreed. Can you agree that if the illegals werent here, then focusing on our home grown drug addicts would be cheaper and more effective? Seriously. At some point stuck up for the countrys rule of law.

"ICE was advised on Dec. 14, 2017 that the county would not be honoring a detainer request made that same day because Perez had not previously been convicted of a first- or second-degree crime," Middlesex County officials previously said in a statement.
"Luis Perez then remained in custody for an additional 51 days where ICE took no action whatsoever, even though they had every right and ability to do so and request an order of deportation from a Federal judge," the statement read. "This order would have authorized Middlesex County to turn over custody of Mr. Perez prior to, or upon completion of his sentence. Instead ICE officials chose to do nothing, which places all responsibility of Mr. Perezs actions squarely upon ICE."

Andres Robles Gonzalez became a citizen when his father was naturalized in 2002. In 2008, Gonzalez was deported to Mexico and was not permitted to return to the United States until 2011. The federal government paid $350,000 in reparations. 
 
This is just one of the thousands of mistaken deportations of US citizens that ICE has committed, the cost is enormous.

After more than two years of litigation, the U.S. government has agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by Leonel Ruiz on behalf of his minor daughter, alleging that in 2011, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and ICE detained and deported his then 4-year-old U.S. citizen daughter.

After her deportation, the childs father hired a local attorney to fly to Guatemala to retrieve her. Once home, three weeks later, she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder by a child psychologist, who concluded that this was a result of her detention and her separation from her parents. The lawsuit, filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), sought damages for the harm she suffered as a result of this ordeal. In June, the government agreed to pay her family $32,500 in order to settle the case.

Well, you might want to reconsider that because there is a case on the way to the supreme court on the very same issue. This one seeks 3.5 billion on behalf of the 12,000 or so that ICE mistakenly deported, (a class action suit) one will dent your future tax bills.
