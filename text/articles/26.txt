Because slaughtering children is a justifiable response to a greedy CEO?

i dont know if anyone heard the news that the suiside rate is so high in rural america it has reduced our life expectancy in the USA. CBS seems oblivious as to why. But its not that hard. The reason why is over the last 30 years all the jobs that kept rural america thriving were shipped to other countries and replaced by service jobs like grubhub, and uber. Jobs where you dont really make money just destroy your car. 
This equals a violation of each and every rural americans civil right to a right to a pursuit of happiness. In that the liberals goal is to make your sell your land and move to a city to survive . its all about Obama master plan for redistribution of wealth

This weeks Bible reading is an excellent reminder of sibling rivalry.  Jacob's favorite son Joseph is sold as a slave by his envious brothers.

It's best to not do business with family, it keeps you from making rational business decisions. Money and blood don't mix, sad story.

Trump would be pan-handling if it were not for his family business, most of which he drove into the ground.

What does this have to do with Trump, or Hillary, or Obama. What are you nuts?

Are you serious? If we are speaking of family and business Trump is the most relevant.

I'd say liberally douse him in gasoline and then toss a lit match, but then I'd be no better than him. May the Devil take him.

The story leaves out the most important part for Fox fans. Is the gun OK?

I wonder what he brother did or said to push him over the edge... to kill your brother, his wife and his children... the level of hate involved there is beyond comprehension.
