So...was he a good guy with a gun, trying to stop the altercation, but shot because he was a black guy with a gun?

no, he was shot because he was running away from the scene with a gun in his hand.  That's pretty stupid to start. 
If you are a good guy in the gun, you'd be running in the other direction.
This is going to be an interesting spin.

How are you going to spin the security guard, with vest on, that they shot? He wasn't running or even standing, not pointing a gun at the cops.. Waiting.

You guys need to improve your comprehension. I am merely talking about this circumstance. I am not even close to being a cop apologist. They have gotten away with murder many times in the last few years. The guy shot dead in the Walmart carrying the air rifle, and the little kid in the play ground.  All those officers should be in jail now. In this case there is an element of doubt - AT THIS MOMENT.  It may end up otherwise. I am prepared to wait and not get tied up in the gnashing of teeth and the manufactured outrage. 
All I said was its not a smart thing to openly carry a gun while running away from the scene of the crime.  If it wasn't exposed, likely he'd just be another person getting out of the way.

This it the second story this week of a good guy with a gun being mistaken for a bad guy by police.

He's yet to be determined a good guy with a gun. He's a guy with a gun, shot at the scene and his gun hasn't been linked to the murder.

Is he hasn't done anything wrong than he IS a good guy with a gun. Or is innocent until proven guilty only for whites?

But you don't know if he did anything wrong or not, therefore he is neither a good guy with a gun, nor guilty of a crime at this time.

Really, please tell me when the last time a White male was shot killed for running, do tell.  People of color are not allowed to run regardless!

When the white guy is known to be mentally ill. 

However, once a mentally ill man was playing with a shiny toy in the street, while his black caregiver was trying to get him to go back inside the care facility next to them. The police shot the caregiver, even though the 911 call had been on the white guy.  The black guy asked the cop why he shot him...the cop answered I dont know.  An honest cop!

Police said they regret that our initial media release was not totally accurate.

Exactly, just like the White police woman who killed a Black male in his own apartment, she walked around free and not charged for over two weeks.

BTW - there's a new DA in Dallas and he's not so forgiving of the white police woman.  The new DA takes office in January so I'll be following to see if any action is taken.

If police officers valued the lives of Black people the way they value their own families, they would take care to never make any mistakes when it comes to taking a black life.
 THIS is why we chant Black Lives Matter.  THIS is why we kneel!

What makes you think the officer isnt black?

I seriously doubt it, however, there are a lot of Uncle Toms on the police department as well as in the White House.

Black live matter isn't fighting "white" cops and their garbage.  It's cops of any color.  Why is that so difficult for you to understand?

The man shot was guilty of 'living while black'. A common problem among certain ethnic types in today's America.  And the reason the police spokesman didn't want to 'get into details' is because they haven't come up with their final cover story yet.

Listen.......if Dylan Roof can be taken alive and then offered Burger King by the police, then the police should take some of these black guys  alive too.

I don't think the caravan metaphor is apt. It's also not ridiculous enough. It should be called something like the "marauding barbarian horde". The contrast between that image, which the cons hope to project, and the image of the actual refugees should be made sharper and more absurd.

Yes, but I think they were characterized as being successful infiltrators. I've never really understood the rationalization for despising Jews. It seems the stereotype is that they are too smart and hard working. But the typical rationalization for despising other groups is that they are too stupid and lazy.

I guess you can only be assumed to be a good guy with a gun if you're white. And you get shot immediately if you're a black suspected mass shooter, but you get taken alive most of the time when you're white. Or in the case of Dylan Roof you get taken alive, and you take him to Burger King. And the racist NRA is always silent when police kill innocent black men

Ok, so you are allowed to OPENLY CARRY your gun in this state. OPENLY CARRY.... OPENLY CARRY... OPENLY CARRY. It was believed that people OPENLY CARRYING would stop bad men with guns. SHOTS FIRED!!! What is the proper legal response for someone who is legally allowed to OPENLY CARRY? Can they then pulled their weapon and attempt to address the bad guy? Should they treat their weapon as merely a clothing accessory? Should they attempt to hide their weapon before the police arrive? Wait... what was the purpose of allowing folks to OPENLY CARRY, again? Another question: was the command - "Freeze, Police!" just Hollywood fiction. Video evidence consistently shows that police are giving commands to people they have already shot (multiple times)

So police respond to a shooting... shoot someone running with a gun and he isn't the shooter?
