That's because Anti-white racism is widely accepted. Imagine the black fear hotline.

Just hang up and start judging people by their actions, instead of their skin color, like Martin Luther King dreamed. This phone line is, by definition, racist. #RacistLeft

Oh please - those of your ilk hated Dr. King in his day. Stop using his name in vain. You should be ashamed of yourself.

There's no racism here. You're just throwing the word around like those who yell fire just for the heck of it.

Racism means persecuting ANY race, not just black people and the left is demonizing ALL white people. That's racist. Period. Try judging people by their actions, like MLK Jr. said. He's probably spinning in his grave, if he can see the perverse hatred that his cause has morphed into. PLUS, the fact that the left is being manipulated into manufacturing racism at every turn by the very elites they claim to oppose. Divide and conquer.#UselessIdiots

Yeah right  David Duke and the likes of you sure do have a lot in common. Trying to shake that racism and thrust it upon someone else just aint gonna cut it., but you keep on dreaming.
 
American history, which youll wish to white-wash, denotes utter contempt towards people of color, which is still going strong today. Thats one reason why black folk dont indulge in republican diaspora.
 
And heres a little something for you to contemplate..black folk reacting to white peoples racism isnt racism on their part.

Yah, yah but its just helping to make things worse, like only whites are racist or do numb racist things. This kind of thing proves otherwise. All racism is bad and only serves to make things worse and that day when folks can overwhelmingly get together on such things just that much farther off.

Your comment is nonsensical. How does this video show anything but racism towards a black man? Yes...the white people taking it upon themselves to police people of color demonstrate pure racism and They are vile for doing it.

Triggered.  You are defending racists, so she must be talking about YOU.  She continuously says RACIST white people, but you apparently didn't hear that.

You just say some word and your right? You don't even sound like you read what I said but just enough for you to be "Triggered". I want things to get better not worse like we've seen the last few years but you apparently didn't read that. "When you're scared, white ... and probably racist!" It's just makes things worse. Like only whites are racists and only whites call the police on people of color and all these folks in the video never call the police on whites. You know most these people are the kind of people that call the police for the littlest thing. Why give ammunition to the folks that are racist and or fear people not like them?
