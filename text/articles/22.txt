Things like this wouldn't happen if legitimate dental care was more affordable, and certification was more readily accessible to foreign trained professionals. Canada complains of doctor shortages..well, there's hundreds of them driving cabs for the last 20 years because their training was deemed "substandard". But I'll tell, you, I've seen the dental work done by "third world" dentists outlast the work done by locals by a good 10 years.

They bought the Time-Life Books series on do-it-yourself dentistry.  Next week the brain surgery series starts.

There is a problem in the dental community whereby there are totally under-served communities that have very little access to dentists because there is not enough money to be made in those communities. There are many things less trained people can do dentally to help offset that deficiency, but the dental community pushes back and demands that only fully licensed dentists do any meaningful work. Some say this is self-serving and others say this is to protect the public. There needs to be a better discussion about it.

Meanwhile dentists are charging you $1000 for a crown, but they are getting it from China for $25. Its perfectly legal and you'll never know unless your dentist tells you

There is no excuse to get a crown made in China, but the cost of the crown for you, the patient, has nothing to do with how much it costs the dentist. The cost to you is for the dentist's time, expertise and for backing up the work over time.

I kept waiting for the big crime to be revealed and ended up disappointed. Where were all the reported victims of botched dentistry? The maiming, the infections, the DEATHS? There was none of that. Their crime? 

NOT OBTAINING PERMISSION FROM THE GOVERNMENT!

If you Bing medical malpractice, you will be rewarded with plenty of news about fully educated, and government licensed practitioners harming their patents. 

A free people do not need government permission.

No, the list of possible broken laws is long. The article makes no mention of tax evasion, midi-care fraud, or illegal infectious waste mishandling. Maybe they did, maybe they didn't.

The only things the article mentions as their "CRIME" was failure to obtain government permission to dispense drugs or operate as a dentist. 

Not one, single act of actual harm is reported.

Once again the Liberal looses focus. The folks in the report harmed NO ONE. Hence, NO CRIME. Others engaged in a similar activity may have harmed people but that is their crime, not the folks in the report. Even then Liberals don't get it. The CRIME was not doing government prohibited dentistry, it was harming people with bad dental practice as the weapon. Just like gun control, Liberals are incapable of grasping the concept that the weapon is not the problem, it is the person performing the harmful act.

Any dentist, government approved or not, should be made to stand before the bar of justice to answer for any harm they cause. If someone chooses to go to the witch doctor dentist and is satisfied with the service, that in none of your business nor is it the business of the government.

You're a man wanting a couple dental implants, then when you wake up you have Dolly Parton sized breast implants.... "uh....Breast implants?! I came here for dental implants!" "Oh....oops....you were one of the dental implant patients? You sure you didn't want Breast implants? Let me double check my schedule....Are you sure you didn't want breast implants? Because I have you written down for breast implants....see....I'll show you....right here see....it says your name right here....Mrs Wanda Jones Dolly Parton breast implants...." "WHAT?! My name isn't WANDA JONES!" "You sure your name isn't Mrs Wanda Jones?" "YES! My name is NOT MRS WANDA JONES! I am a man named John Jackson!" "Oh....Because I thought you said your name was....Wanda Jones....to make up for the error....I can give you a discount on a teeth cleaning...." LOL you get what you pay for....Surgery of any kind on a bus, in a dive motel room....You get what you pay for and so its never a good idea! :)
