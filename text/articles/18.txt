Next time the swimmer needs to wear a wetsuit and carry a flashlight and flotation device.

Oh my God, it's an invasion.

Better call up another 15,000 troops...

Shame on you.
The well intentioned rescue attempt probably cost the US taxpayers a few thousand dollars. Nice, but expensive.

Oh, I forgot. You wouldn't have to because you live in Russia...
