Atesiano is just one of many.  I shudder to imagine how many people are languishing in jail/prison in order to meet some department's quota.

Nowhere NEAR enough time and he deserves ZERO compassion. Allowing him to spend time with mother before beginning his sentence is a kick to the teeth of every person guilty or innocent who missed life events while serving time.

Let's hope prison "justice" picks up where the corrupt system failed.

Actually, I was thinking he metaphorically effed a black man, poetic justice demands he experience the same, only a little more realistically.

As a retired lawman myself (and one who played by the rules)  I'd say these guys got off WAY too easy.  It really frosts me when cops delude themselves into thinking that the way to deal with criminals is to become criminals themselves.

You are so right.  How is this man who destroyed so many lives, can get off so easily?
You wonder why people protest and why athletes take a knee?!

Getting ... off so easily? Only time will tell. There may be relatives of the wrongly convicted in the prison he goes into. May it happen quickly.

"One of the three victims who served five years...falsely accused..."

Shouldn't all the cops involved serve at least five years?  They not only disrupted someone's life in a horrible way, they betrayed their job and took tax payer money while committing crimes.

Exactly.  The disproportionate sentences are disgusting.

They, the disproportionate sentences, are the norm for non Whites in most of the cases.

Their sentence should be as long as the accumulated sentences of their victims.  That would seem more just to me. .. and they should pay the victims and their families.

What a joke. 3 years? How many lives did this monster ruin? How much confidence in the PD did he undermine? Only in Florida where political insiders rule the day.  Hint...Hint...investigate the damn judge who sentenced him!

Right?  The least they should get is the accumulated sentences of those they put behind bars unlawfully!  Impeach that judge!

So, he gets less time in prison than the innocent men he helped frame? 
His sentance should have been calculated by multiplying the number of framed men by the total number of years they were given. And then adding 50.

A white lady I know adopted 2 black boys and raised them. She used to tell me how the cops would harass and try to frame them, and how there was this secret conspiracy to sabotage black people's lives by giving them a bogus parking ticket or something, then waiting for them to miss the deadline to pay it, then either tacking on huge penalties and interest or issuing them a summons for failure to appear, which would result in them having a police record, etc., etc.

I used to roll my eyes at these stories. It can't possibly be like that, I thought. Not in America.

How foolish I was!

Shame on you if you're waiting around for someone else to validate you.  I would say that their behavior validates the exact opposite -- fear of inferiority.  That's the actual root of their problem.

What are you blabbering about? I don't need validation, because I experienced it first-hand. I just was making the point that the original poster was making when she said she didn't believe her friend. Maybe in a mixed up way you were trying to make a point, but it got lost in translation.

Latino supremacists, stand in the hate line behind white supremacists.
You see, the whole world has aligned itself against the black race. You have to wait your turn to stomp on us.
Where are these guys from, Mexico, Cuba,  Latin America? Where ever they came from, they came with hatred and bigotry in their hearts.

Down here in South Florida theres no group worse than the Miami Cubans. They absolutely hate blacks and even hate other Hispanics. Its the norm down here.

Wouldn't they be the brutal autocrats and criminals (or there young children at the time) who castro kicked out when he got rid of the corrupt regime? Explains their culture.

These guys should serve sentences at least as long as the longest one they pinned on innocent men. A year, two, three, not enough by a long shot!

Only 27 months for him and only TWELVE months for the 2 officers who helped him?  So, they get a slap on the wrist for framing black men, one of whom spent FIVE years in prison before being released?

I hope that guy, who spent 5 years, is suing the town for millions and collects every dime.  Cities/towns are too quick to turn a blind eye to this stuff UNLESS it costs them, dearly, and it will when their property and sales taxes go sky high.

Ahh, Florida.  This probably occurs everywhere.  We took away weed arrests in Michigan, so can't wait to hear about the uptick in other arrests.

Why should he be given time with his mother? How many people did he rob of that right?

His mother deserves "time," too. For raising a sociopath.
