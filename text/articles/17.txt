I was an actual student under these two women. I would like you to know several things: they were NOT nice people, it was obvious they were stealing however if suspicions were ever brought up veiled threats easily quashed them, they are NOT sorry as they were only caught after retiring, my education was sub-par and was wholly unprepared for the transition to HS (I went to St. James from K-8th), and the facilities were subpar - (i.e. 2 classrooms were trailers with no AC for the longest time) as well as no A/C in the main classroom building even in the sweltering springs/early summers of southern CA. They themselves should NEVER had been allowed to be around children let alone teach/manage them.

sad, so sad. there's examples of this in every walk of life, whether business, education, government, etc. these incidents involving religion are the worst as the culprits portrayed a humble, christian life. just a shame!

They stole from Peter but declined to pay Paul. I've never seen a nun in a jumpsuit.

Note to Editor: The map in this article is wrong. It shows the location of the church in Redondo Beach; however, the school is located further east in Torrance at Garnet St and Anza Ave.

you are mistaken. The Church and original St James school is located on PCH in Redondo as shown on the map. I know because I went there all 8 years back in the 60's. the church is on the west side of PCH and the school is across PCH on the east side. The school you are thinking of is St James Annex on Anza, which was opened in the mid 60's and still is today. Back then the original school held 1-2 and 7-8 grades. The annex handeled 3rd through 6th grades.

laker fan, you are mistaken. your experience was over 50 years ago. The school is located where lat0001 says. The school on Garnet is now k-8 and the east side of PCH is the church office and meeting rooms.

My Aunt was a Nun for over 70 years during that time she taught in Catholic schools, was a Prep school Principal, was the full Professor of Biology at a Catholic College, the head of the Biology Department, she was the mother superior. 

My other aunt told me that when they were allowed to drop the habits in the 70s ( she had a Doctorate from the Univ. Of Florida and was a Full Professor at this time) because how was she going to afford to buy clothes. My other Aunt told her Mary ( her birth name) we will go to the Fabric store and I will make you a few suits to start. 

In her last few year my Aunt wanted to break her sister out of the nun retirement home and found out that my nun Aunt had to donate her pay checks from the schools, Catholic grade school, prep school, college/ University back to the order then the most she was ever given was $120/mo for expenses. My Aunt just died in 2015 @89. 

Yes, after the first year college tuition that my grandfather paid, when she joined the convent they paid for her next 3 years of college. Then they paid for her masters at Catholic Univ. Followed by her Doctored in Ed. At Florida. I remember her and her best friend another nun, who just happened to be the University President getting a trip to Jereselum. She, the Univ President and one other nun lived in a small ranch house on campus. ( no regular University President would have lived in their modest 1200-1500 3/1 house). Every year a donor/ car dealer let the Univ President/ nuns drive a modest car from his fleet ( a charitable write-off, that they then used for fund raising). 

So trying living on $120/mo. How many Univ. professors with a Doctorate would do that. 

Then in the end they took my aunts motorized scooter away and gave it to another nun. See more...

I would like to hear the complete story before passing judgement. My daughter is a teacher at a Catholic school and the pay is very low. Beginning Catholic school teachers with credentials earn about $15,000 less than beginning LAUSD teachers. With 2 Masters, a credential and 7 years experience my daughter is finally making the salary of a beginning public school teacher. The nuns make even less. We may learn that these two nuns were taking money to buy food, pay rent and buy necessities. Nuns don't live in convents anymore and we know the high cost of living in LA is not affordable for many, maybe even nuns..

the nuns stole from the school. no need to hear more. The nun's order is paying back the school, so they believe the allegations are true.

That's why a lot of catholic teachers leave to teach at public schools...it's their choice to stay. I have friends who stay at their jobs at the catholic schools because they really like where they work. As for waiting to hear the complete story, what more evidence to you need? They took money that wasn't theirs period. It doesn't make it acceptable to steal money just because you don't make enough money. It should be up to the Archdiocese to make sure the nuns have enough to live a simple life. You are making excuses for them so that they can steal instead of going the right way to pay for living expenses. They don't pay rent; the church pays for their rent. They have made a vow to live this life, and it doesn't matter where they live whether in a convent, nun order, or an apartment. If they are not getting enough $, then make it public so that the church is held accountable.See more...

So poverty gives people the right to steal from others? Exactly how does that logic work?

Thoughts and prayers. But for whom? The nuns who must now live with what they have done or the parents whose funds, ultimately, were what was taken.

Until we know how much money was taken each year and all together, I think we would do well to suppress our unseemly outrage just a bit. These are, after all, two old women who, through whatever circumstances of their lives that we will never know, were compelled to join a religious order of nuns. I think it is almost certain that they lived a simple life without the luxuries and daily comforts that we take for granted. Is there anybody so outraged or poverty stricken or hateful that they would actually LIKE to see these two old women "PUNISHED TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THE LAW?!?" I am not now or ever have been been so mean spirited, as seriously flawed as I am. I'll bet most of us spent more on beer during those womans' "crime spree." Oh, and by the way, unless these are Franciscan Nuns, these women likely did not have to take a vow of poverty.

But they weren't old when they started taking money!! So don't use being old as an excuse. It doesn't matter how much money they stole anyway....they took money that wasn't theirs. It would be the responsibility of the Archdiocese to make sure they had enough money. If they weren't getting enough $ to live a simple life, then they should have gone thru the proper channels. And if they did do that...then they should have made it publicly known so that the church could be held accountable. But yes, you don't know all the details of this story, but the bottom line, they had to have stolen a substantial amount of money. Do you think the news bureaus would cover this story if they didn't?

Also try 1.4 million...still feel sorry for them?

So, where did you get that sum? Perhaps is was pulled out your rectal orifice, otherwise please let us know.

Yes. If you donated your hard earned money to two women who had a house, free food, donated vacations and stole from childen, you would want to see them treated as the criminals they are.

Good example of unseemly outrage and illogical suppositions. See joeeg's post above for a more rational view of what nuns get to live on for all the work they do as school administrators and teachers.

Well, it's a step up from molesting children...
Avatar
There's a lot of that happening in public schools. It was hidden for a long time.
Avatar
And an argument could be made that they took money that would have been spent defending the molesters...

True, if your assumption is correct. But how do we know what else these two were doing behind doors? I don't trust anyone with a white collar (or who works for church) to be around young boys or money.
