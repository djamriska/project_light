But the question is- will the "Mexican nationals" be deported, or allowed to stay as if they were some type of "victims" of a crime???

I question where the $6,000-$7,000 these migrants are willing to pay come from.  This is not the first time we have seen reports of this amount of money be paid to come to the U.S.  If they afford this type of payment living can't be "all that horrible" in their countries.

They do not have the cash.  They end up as somebody's indentured servant (slave) until the entry fee is paid.

8 U.S. Code 1324 ........... Of course this law applies to those cement heads in Kaliforniastan and those other "Left Coast" bastions of Liberal Socialism. Can't wait for the new Attorney General to start laying waste to Jug Head Jerry Brown's Utopia and those cement heads in Oregon and Washington state.

If the military (isolated case) is human trafficking for cash then I would speculate that mega dollars are involved and the smuggling is done in much more elaborate and successful ways than these two dummies attempted. Go Figure. Bottom line...Thank You Mr. Obama and a very special thanks to the current US Congress as well as to the leaders of sanctuary environs. You have done well in your continuous attempts at ruination of our nation.

Of course the headline mentions his guard status because they have one goal which is to discredit anything related to main-taining our national sovereignty. They count on people jumping to conclu-sions without reading the article.
