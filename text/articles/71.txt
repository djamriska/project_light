I'm glad there will be an investigation.  I immediately thought this was a setup.  Cops on a power trip in Ohio.  Enough said.

Good ole cop with that  Higher standards they are alway screaming at us. But when we see police in actiIons with real citizens they are showing that citizen who the boss is. If  in war would have acted like some of them. We would be in jail....from a veteran

Any day there is an investigation of corrupt cops is a good day. The right to have a badge and a gun carries heavy responsibility and accountability. Cops unwilling to account for their actions need to be banned from serving in any precinct in the US.

"who claims to have had an affair with Donald Trump a decade before he was elected president"

It's not a claim. It's a fact. One that both parties have admitted to.

Her arrest was no mistake. Given the corruption in this WH, it has Trump and Cohen's name written all over it!

I hope that works out well for you, Mark.  Good luck with that.  Hopefully someone is there after you all kill yourselves to call the police.

Bad phrasing. It's not a Democratic Congress when Republicans are in charge.

The FBI, want to know who was behind it all, and if the harassment was being directed by and from inside of the White House, to smear and try to destroy Stormy Daniels. As I suspect it is the main reason behind this investigation.

Statistically, Black people, who account for a much smaller percentage of the population are gunned down at a much higher rate than white people.  Google the stats on that.

And they should! In more than 99% or police misconduct reports, the Columbus police find no wrongdoing on the part of the officers! The Columbus police are corrupt and they have been corrupt for a very long time!

Police abusing their power goes on All Day, Every Day, Everywhere. This is like polishing clean a grain of sand, in the Sahara.

For many years movies and TV shows made Internal Affairs divisions look bad, a bunch of rats trying to derail true heroes out of resentment and jealousy. Now I'm a fan of IA.

Until we, as a people, figure out how to create a balanced police force, this will continue to happen.

Most police officers, probably All, are conservatives. Many of them are racists and many of them use steroids. We need to re-create the job of the 'police officer' to reflect what America is, not what Republicans are. 

'To Protect and Serve', not to 'Frighten and unnerve'.
