Okay let me get this straight. This guy got arrested for hate crime (basically), fought the POLICE officer, broke a window of a police cruiser and he's out on a BAIL??? Tell me this is not a white privilege.

It's always been like this.  It's just been ignored by the press.

"...broke the back window of a police cruiser and fought with police officers. After he was subdued, he was taken to a hospital." WHITE PRIVILEGE IS A HELL OF A THING! Imagine that! Right now in my head is an image of two white, male police officers assualting a 14 year old Black girl, while she is on the ground "subdued", one cop kneels on her back and repeatedly socks her in the side of her stomach, while pulling her shorts up so high she probably is no longer a virgin. DAMN....

What a disgrace. There were many nativists back in the day who tried to kick his ancestors out.

I would like to see his records.
4 years active duty,  a Ranger, only a PFC, and 3 deployments to Afghanistan? 
Those numbers don't add up very well.

He was probably getting his rank and then losing it due to his behavior. He should have made Staff Sgt.  with the time he had in all things being considered.

So, we know what side this soldier will be on in the next phase of the war. The question is how many of the military will side with the fascists.

he's a nut. Feel sorry that his past experiences in the military have led him here.

The authors provided the subtext that his military experience made him a murderous racistand I aint buying it. I dont think you should make that assumption either. Plenty of combat veterans dont end up this waythe vast majority dont.

It shows that he is a bad white man who assaulted the cops and came away with a mere $800.00 in bail.

a bad person that did not get charged for what he should have. Also, he did not get shot while fighting with police, while other do w/o fighting with police, just while running away.

White privilege strikes again! Just last week a police officer explained  to an 11 & a 13 year old that they were luck he didnt kill them for playing outside with a toy(BB)gun. According to the officer, children playing with a toy would frighten him more than an ex army ranger who fought them and damaged government property! #THISISAMERICA

This "scholarly" individual just can't be satisfied with the special white privilege he has. He still wants to stick it to anyone who doesn't look like him. 
And for anyone denying that "privilege", how many non-whites fight with cops and live to gloat about it? Crickets.

He chased the Uber driver from his own vehicle while threatening to beat him up. He announced he wanted to kill him because he was "brown". He fought with officers and broke the window in the police cruiser.
He was arrested on SUSPICION of a bias-motivated crime, obstructing a peace officer, menacing and attempt to escape. He was RELEASED on $800 bond.
And, in spite of all his white privilege, he's angry at the "brown" guy.

This is the new "morality" that far-right fake Christians and the amoral GOP have given America.  Sad.

Yes, Colorado Springs is a beautiful place to live, but it's also full of people just like this guy. However, driving a taxi, I drive days, taking care of little old ladies, and they're grateful that their brown skinned driver goes out of his way to make sure that they are taken care of properly and respectfully. Not all white people, even if they are Republicans, are total absolute jerks.
