Why haven't the white community leaders come out to condemn this attack?  Where is Laura Ingraham, Hannity or all the Rich Mega Preachers from Texas?

The shooter was White. They have to come up with a reason that will blame someone else. It might take a day or two.

They're probably worn out painting the would-be pipe bomber as anything but a hateful racist.

I finally realized that President Trump and Evangelicals backed by Republicans have unleashed the darkest part of Man.  There is no going back now.  
It has started with the President, Evangelicals, Conservatives, White Supremacists, and Republicans demonetization, the us against them mentality, random violence against LGBTQ People, Minorities, Immigrants, the poor, the disabled,  Jewish People, Mexicans, Blacks, and other vulnerable individuals and groups of people.  
Then you will see more systematic acts of violence until whole groups of people will be targeted.  Tragically our Leader has a following that has started committing these  heinous acts.
The genie is out of the bottle and the most powerful Nation in the World is now becoming the most Brutal country in the World.
We are beyond the end of our Democracy, our Republic, we are now a violent Theocratic State with a Dictator supported by a Religion that lacks morality and decency.   Our enemies may regret what any interference has helped stoked.

Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, imprisoned; yet we have not advanced an inch towards uniformity. What has been the effect of coercion? To make one half the world fools, and the other half hypocrites. To support roguery and error all over the earth." - Thomas Jefferson, from "Notes on Virginia"

Religious leaders have no place condemning "hate in this world".  Religion is part of the problem.

These Religious leaders need to speak against the hate, and fear being preached daily by the President of the United States.   Any supporting Trump should ask God for forgiveness.

Hundreds of religious leaders do speak out.  However it does not make the news.  Who would turn in watch a non-violent do nothing speech about peace and love?  Anyone?  No one I know.  We are only riveting to the TV and media when something awful happens.

Evangelicals, who continue to worship Trump, are loving it. Instead of saying "amen", they now also say "MAGA".

I just read on CNN that the shooter's social media posts indicated his belief that Jews were transporting the members of the dreaded Honduran caravan. Which means that the blood of those people is on 45's hands.

Religious institutions like the evangelical southern Baptist, a political arm of the Republican party, now white nationalist party,  must be held directly responsible for the moral decay of America. 
Why is it news when these so called religious organizations condemn events like today? The southern Baptist supports the NRA that evil institution responsible for flooding our streets with guns. Hypocrites.

There are gradations, Tyler. Every religion has its zealots. I am not a person of faith, but I recognize some positives. Imagine what some people would do if not constrained by their (admittedly manufactured) religious beliefs.

If the slaughter of little children in CT didnt move the politicians to action, this latest tragedy will not.  Remember, after the deadliest attack on Jews in American history, their President went off to a campaign rally, to attack his political enemies. It would be nice if he gave up his weekend golf while the Nation mourns.
