This is what I've been advocating ever since this caravan started out.  Don't come north; head south.  They speak the language already, the weather is nice, and besides--we'd rather not have them here as we have our own criminal element and poor people.  We don't need those from other countries, too.

If we keep importing enough poor and destitute from 3rd world countries, guess what our country will begin to look like?

You don't pay taxes, so don't worry about it. It won't effect your EBT much.

What was it Eisenhower warned against? Hint, it's right below this line.

"We are in an era of great power competition," Mattis said. "But as President Trump has said, competition 'does not always mean hostility, nor does it inevitably lead to conflict.' It wont, if we continue to invest in strength. This is true of Americas relationship with China."

Panama only has 4.1 million people.

They're not going to allow tens of thousands of bums to come in for handouts.

We didn't steal the land from the natives so others could just come and live here.

The USA is no different from any other country in history.
We were just among the latest to do so.
We were also the most successful.

If you're expecting another WWII, you are sadly mistaken.

If you have an IQ over 90, and you still want open borders, you should get re-tested.

Believe it or not, the average I.Q in this country is only 98, look it up. Damn scary when you really actually think about it...the top 2% are the ones who create our future, and we need better odds than that..if we're going get off this rock.

Panama's wealth is all window dressing...Without the infusion of capital from the increased use of the upgraded canal they would be in worse shape than all but Venezuela. Added to that, much of their increased wealth is due to expats from the US willing to pay overinflated prices for homes and haciendas. Panama inherited millions of dollars of homes and property within the former Canal Zone from the US military.
