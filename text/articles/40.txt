Heard today that the Mayor of TJ says it's costing his city $30,000 a day to take care of the invaders. WOW, I'm sold!! That's $3.30 per day per person. That's a real bargain when realize what it costs us tax payers in Californication each year. I say let Moonbeam and Gavin Nausea pay the city of TJ with the bullet train money!

Disappointed they only used pepper spray ammo. Save that for Chicago and the likes.  Use real bullets, make the invaders think twice.

As expected the media focuses on the use of tear gas by the Border Service but of course never mentions that during Obama's administration it was used extensively. In 2012 it was used 27 times; in 2013 it was used 26 times and then decreased but still in Obama's last year 2015 it was used 3 times at the border.
Not a word from the Trump hating media.

The United States recognizes the right of asylum of individuals as specified by international and federal law. A specified number of legally definedrefugees who apply for refugee status overseas, as well as those applying for asylum after arriving in the U.S., are admitted annually.

this means line up come in at port of entry and apply.

Oh, they had an idea. They were told repeatedly not to come. NOT TO COME! They came anyway, some dragging small kids, hoping that would garner sympathy.

Were these people actually convinced that all they had to do is just get to the border and walk right in. What did they think was going to happen when they threw rocks and start climbing.

This issue runs deeper than the politics behind it, if we allow this it will set a new precedent in our country and the free world.
I agree but Mexico has no back bone!!!!!!!

America has no obligation to help these people. They are Mexico's responsibility as per international law.

Here's a thought you identify all of those who rushed the fence... there are plenty of videos... Those who are identified are refused any chance of legal entry.

No it wont , we have a responsibility here at home, we need to take care of things here
in American ,not these people who show up demanding something they are not remotely intitled to, we as a nation need to stand and be willing to draw a line in the sand and put them and the world on notice that America will not tolerate this kind of thing any longer.
If we do not our nation will be consumed by every other.
