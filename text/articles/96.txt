The Cop lied and was wrong. They won't be able to prove that it was murder and the Cop will get off. A classic trick of deliberately over charging a police suspect. They do it down here all the time. I'd have more faith if they charged him with manslaughter.

Why did it take four years to being him to trial?

Although other cases took even longer...

Must be really hard to indite a cop.

In America next to impossible. Police State like societies and a corrupt system make it as hard as any 3rd world country.

It's the USA's version of a speedy trial.

Police superintendent admits mistakes have been made in the Black and Latino communities. Now that is a step in the right direction. My foot. If he was aware of these mistakes he should have done something about them when he became Superintendent. I recall when the new major was elected in New York City the entire police force turned their backs to him when he made a speech promising improvement in the relationship between minorities and the police department. It may be sold as a few rogue cops being out of line but the reality shows that entire precincts are guilty. It is not a few rogue cops but a few decent cops who are afraid to open their mouths. Maybe it is the Serpico history that sets the rules.

The cop shot the teenager SIXTEEN times?  Who did this cop think the kid was?
Superman?

Look up the "Tueller Drill" - police are trained to use deadly force for knife-wielding assailants within 20 feet. However, given the number of officers present, and the relatively slow escalation - kid didn't pull knife and immediately charge - nobody thought to have tasers in hand and use them?

not 20 feet actually its much father. 35 feet is normally considered to still be a dangerous situation. Part of it is the fear factor that is drill into these civilians. Cops after all are still just civilians with a badge. So even with overwhelming force they are terrified of any situation where total compliance is not followed.

16. Incompetence or compensating?

The reasoning is that if lethal force is necessary, you shoot until the threat is ended. Or as one prosecutor put it: If it's okay to kill him, it's okay to kill him twice.
The issue with this particular shooting is that McDonald was stumbling along, knife in hand. He punctured a tire on a police car and walked past the shooter, apparently ignoring commands.
So it is a real question as to whether the shooter - at the time of the shooting - had a reasonable fear of death or serious bodily harm. And, if he did not, did he had probable cause to believe that McDonald was a threat to the police or the public?
IMHO, the dashcam video doesn't show that McDonald was a threat to the officer. However, he was armed with a knife and was very close to the officer (but not facing him.)
Oh well, that's why we have juries. 
But I think that Officer Van Dyke is in real trouble.

Anyone willing to take bets against the jury in this case (and the alternates) being comprised of more than one African-American, even though we comprise a substantial part of the population of Chicago?

The outcome of this shooting was predestined the the moment the cop open fire on him.

The police union should set up a fund coming straight from all officer's paychecks every month or maybe from their so-called "forfieture laws" for insurance that the settlements that police are forcing taxpayers to have to pay for cop incompetence and brutality is coming out of COP'S POCKETS. Taxpayers should NOT have to pay for police brutality EVER. Police and their union should be responsible for this. It could/would be different if cops were forced to pay for their own misconduct. It's time to correct this brutality and tax dollars spent on it.

We hope Justice is done this time. But no guarantee on a case where cops lied and covered up for each other so blatantly.

Four years later?  Nothing like swift justice for law enforcement crimes.

I guess Kaepernick was really way off base huh?  This shooting was obviously a total accident.  I mean it is so easy to accidently put 16 rounds into  one of our citizens and not realize your gun had gone off.  Incredible.

But they say this is a war on cops. This is a war on bad cops. So sad the police union" refuse " to acknowledge this fact when evidence is so clear. The Head Judge sees all regardless what an earthly judge rules. We will reap what we sow.

Probably more than 2,000 murders, mostly black on black, since this shooting.  Where's the outrage for that?  

In reality, the only people harder to indict/convict than a cop are black murderer's as evidenced by the extremely low homicide clearance rate of  the Chicago PD.

Since 2001, tens of thousands of Americans have killed other Americans like the Sandy Hook shooting, or the killing of the concert-goers in Vegas!  Wheres the outrage for that?

Actually in-public mass shootings are relatively rare - certainly not involving thousands of people in eight years. There usually is no trial, as the shooter nearly always ends up dead. And there is plenty of public outrage, though it is misdirected at people and organizations not involved in the shooting.

You are seriously misinformed or very ignorant.  The outrage for those incidents were the days and weeks of continued media coverage.  In one weekend in Chicago there were 65+ shootings with 10-12 dead.  That's one city.  After two weeks there were less than 5 arrests, WTF???  Please try to defend that.
