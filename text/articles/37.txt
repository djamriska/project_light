This is the cartels taking advantage of the caravan diversion. The cartels are betting on the officers in the ports to be too busy with blocking the human herd, and performing less inspections. 

The thing you need to ask yourself, if this is what they are catching, how much made it through?

All one has to do is run a Google search on heroin addiction in America, and you will see the cartels are quite successful in their smuggling ventures.

Build the friggin wall!

Drug cartels are terrorists and should be treated as such.

To be fair, the cartel honchos live life like rodents. Running and hiding all the time with a really low life expectancy ...

Mexico is not forcing drugs on America. America buys all the drugs it can get. America seems to want them.

Yes because the more cartels in this country, the more guns they buy. Abkut 70% of the guns   seized in Mexico from these dealers can be traced back to the United States. Someone is making big money in the states from drugs getting in. Border wall to keep people out? Try a designated team to check people going out the same way theres a team checking people coming in.

Boy! Is this a revolving door.  Drug cartels sell their wares as millions die of drug overdoses and we as Americans pay trillions to police, jail, investigate , collect, incarcerate plus court costs , new laws, the list goes on . Just think if we stopped drugs trafficking for good all the money we would save all the money we could pay our debts fix the infrastructure improve healthcare all by ending drug cartels and their operations.

The fentanyl comes from China, the oxycontin comes from the drug industry and crooked US doctors.

You forgot the small little detail that the US consumers pay a lot of money for these drugs and keep very high demand year after year. 

What do you expect cartels to do? Stop making millions and millions of dollars and get a 9-5 job? assuming there are even jobs available.

Read an article the other day, the commercial truck traffic crossing that border checkpoint is well over 13,000 vehicles a day. On average BP looks at about every 7th truck, no way in the world to monitor them all.

tha's right. but our agents are experienced and have a fairly good track record of detecting contraband, and they have tools to find it. Its just an overwhelming number of dirty crossers

of course everybody knows its a five for them one for us deal anyway, at least we're getting some.

Don't close your mind to solutions because there are ways to stop this drug traffic and not rely on dogs or check points. Our approach has been too broad this is why they can get around it.  We need to employ technology that is by design set up to track see and find drugs on all shipments into this country. You don't pick and chose because you know before what is there. You also track where these trucks for one come from so you can follow it back to the sourse without drug cartels knowing then take them out. Take control globally of drug cartel accounts and funds without any foreign protection standing in the way.   This would be a silent war not much to see but totally deadly.

My guess is the more difficult it becomes for the drug cartels to conduct business the less they are going to like members of the caravan. Stay tuned.

17 pounds of Fentanyl.  You'd need a bio hazard suit to handle that amount safely.

One of the beautiful side effects of having so many law enforcement agents massed at the border. They should stay there even after the caravan is gone.

God bless the CBP! Those drugs kill people, and lead to most of America's crimes. No wonder Democrats want an open border.
