She developed severe diarrhea and vomiting. Complications from AIDS. Who knows where the abuse came from?

I am 100% certain that her death while in ICE custody would have been prevented if she stayed in Honduras.

Transgender, AIDS infected.  Sounds like someone we should welcome with open arms into the country.

"Her death was entirely preventable", I agree, she could have not illegally entered this country. Bad things happen everyday to people in and out of jail.

Concerning, the lefties are using the "family also released a statement through Free and the Transgender Law Center".  This is available to AMERICANS! not immigrants trying to come here.  The presidentg, as in the Commander and Chief, wants to make America great again, and he is stopping the force that wants to break down the borders.  Let them come to the wall as a human stampede, several 50 cal machine guns will mow them down without failure.  I hope they know, he is not kidding, he will keep the borders protected.

I wonder if this independent autopsy listed the gender of Mr. Rodriguez as male or female.   I know in today's political correct world everyone is free to identify with whatever gender they wish but has the medical community also bought into this.

She left with dreams of opening a beauty salon and hopes of helping us out. She fled Honduras because here transgender people are discriminated against.

Wait a minute...why was he coming here then? Every day you hear about how trans are discriminated against in this country.

There should be some form of health screening for all immigrants like there was on Ellis Island. Today, even those with AIDS can come in. Our citizens are at risk for many diseases because of the many illegals coming in. The family should have made her stay home and take meds, They are responsible for her death.

Rodriguez had AIDS, and yet, got across our border and we had to deal with it.   Along with AIDS, they are bringing TB, lice, VD, etc. Build the Wall for the Health, Safety, and Security of our Nation.

I wonder where they got the idea that she was deprived of water?  Dehydration is common when people have illnesses.  Why keep her in cuffs?  Was she combative?  HIV is threatening to others, of course.  Maybe they were worried that she would put her body fluids on someone else.  Who knows.

yes.  it was preventable.  this individual could have stayed in Honduras.  Could have opted to engage in "safe" sex rather than getting HIV.  Could have opted not to enter the country illegally.

Don't know if this person is a he/she or a she/he, don't care. This person had advanced HIV, the autopsy identified the cause of death as dehydration and HIV complications. The severe diarrhea would explain the dehydration. Those camps and centers aren't fill with saints but they didn't kill this person a disease did, says it right in the report.

Died of dehydration and complications from HIV.

This guy was dying when he first made the fool decision to travel in hot weather for days and days on end in an effort to illegally invade a country.

Adios, Senor.

Your demise had nothing to do with your female fantasy.

Another example of how many lives and how much money we could save by building that wall.  For the sake of the illegal immigrants who are risking their lives trying to get into the US and those legal immigrants and citizens who are put at risk when they actually make it into the country do it soon.  With a sturdy wall and the proper over watch the flood of violent illegal immigrants will slow to at worst a slow drip.  As for the trauma, the culture she came from is far from supportive of LGBT rights.  If her fellow immigrants knew what she was they likely kicked the stuffing out of her.

I think it is safe to say, this is no "she", born a male, dressed up in girls clothes, still a male

" New Mexico showed evidence that she was beaten, reports said Tuesday."
  
  It was in NEW MEXICO!!!!!!!!!

There is no way ICE could have done this in a day.
   What happened was IT threw it's self onto the wall and probably try to force it's way over the wall.  Met with justice and was transported. 
   We are not hearing the full story here.
   Just so happens to be a freak of nature.

No timeline was given on when the injuries occurred. For all you know they happened right before the person was in custody.

These people keep breeding like there's no tomorrow.  They are turning lush green lands into deserts.  Those of you who get excited about global warming, take note.  Over-population is what will get us.  These breeders spawn sub-humans who can't even take of themselves.  Disease takes over because Mother Nature must cull the herd.  Otherwise, all will perish.  In the meantime, the simple minded continue to breed and breed.  Animals seem to be able to keep the balance of nature yet these so-called humans can't.  Go figure.
