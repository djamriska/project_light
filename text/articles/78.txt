Perfect illustration of the double standard and the downplayinfication of racism when it's concern murder of black body.  So sickening

I am confused if you shoot a person of color in the back right after you tried to enter a black church why is there any questions you were motivated by hate?

They had to investigate? Who are they kidding? No it was just a matter of mistaken identity. The shooter just intended to make a visit and the gun went off accidentally. Of course this was racially motivated. If you question the motives in order to diminish the severity you are the same as the guy holding the gun.

There is a lot to investigate because a white man cannot be such an openly racist murderer. It is pure coincidence that be bypassed white patrons and accidentally randomly shot the only black people he crossed path. That's all. Black and brown people you can believe them to be wanton murderers and bigots but not white people...

Why is it so difficult for white southerners to admit they're racists?  I don't get it.  They did the same thing with Dylan Roof.   Just so you know, black folks don't go to church empty-handed anymore.

That is a really stupid statement on your part. Not all Southerners are racist, and it is irresponsible of you to say that.   You really should think about what you are  saying before you spray your hate in the comment section.

I know that Mitch McConnell isnt up for re-election this time but, for whatever reason, McConnell must be trying to shed his reputation as a racist just before the upcoming mid-term elections.

Seriously, they are reviewing the case. He first tries to get into a black church but is turned away and then goes to a grocery store and guns down two blacks. When confronted by a white guy with a gun, he says "whites don't shoot whites". This isn't rocket science. Anybody with a fraction of a brain cell can see this was a hate crime.

If these arent definitions of hate crimes, I dont know what a hate crime is, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Monday.

He said this right after chastising Trump for his inflammatory rhetoric.... just kidding, he'll never do that.

Well he can discuss his hatred for people of color while in prison.  I'm sure he'll find allllllll the people he love to hate, ready to have a meaningful "prison style symposium" with him.

Was he feeling love in his heart when he shot random black people

Not trying to be insensitive, but I do not understand why we have a separate classification of murder based on hate.  What the heck does that have to do with anything.  If someone is killed because someone wanted their money versus the fact that didn't like the color of their skin, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?  The person is still dead and the perpetrator is still just as guilty for taking that life.

It just seems like a stupid concept.
