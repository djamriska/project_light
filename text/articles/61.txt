How about don't do stuff that sends you to prison?

Doesn't seem that hard to me.

Bad guys are bad guys and should be fairly punished, but I believe that the system could be reformed as well, seems a bit too tough.

Here's another idea: Stop committing crimes. I've managed to do it my entire life. It's not hard.

On the one hand, criminal justice reform is an issue that libs and conservatives can work together on (unless you are part of the black caucus that voted against the recent criminal reform bill).

On the other hand, this guy only has himself to blame for his problems.  2007 gun and drug case, 2 arrests in 2017 and now again.  Please, stop breaking the law and you won't end up in prison.

A RAPPER! A CRIMINAL! Now they want their hand held, tucked into bed and nighty night. Their in there for a reason and its not for being a good civil servant. Meek the place is not a hotel, most of the problems are your in there with some pretty bad dudes. GET OVER IT! Their not wet nurses get it.

I thought if you did time you got more cred for your rap career.  But, in your case it should've been a probation, fine and community service.

He thinks black people are too dumb to obey the law. As a black person who has obeyed the law all my life I resent that.

No priors and gets prison for riding a minibike?  Proof 
POC are railroaded to for profit prisons.  We know cops are paid a commission for rounding up and imprisoning innocent minorities.  They draw lots at beginning of each shift to pick who gets the bounty, paid by trump.

This  is not an innocent man. Didnt you read the article. He is playing the victim card. If he had obeyed the law no one would have rounded him up as you say. He made his own bed hard.

Please ppl I think you are getting Pennsylvania confused with other states. Pennsylvania is a Commonwealth and what is considered a serious crime here and given a bunch of time is just probation in other counties. You could spend easily over 5 years in and out of jail and on probation here for petty crimes just above ticket grade. Crimes that don't send you to prison at first but do in the end because you can't meet the programming requirements and work and support yourself independently. Who wants to hire someone who has appointments 5 days a week? Many times here you see pedophiles get a slap on the wrist get out and reoffend because they only went to prison for a year or two while you see ppl with addiction problems condemned to life in and out of prison without even committing any new crimes just for these technical violations which they fully exploit to lock you up to get more taxpayer money for the contractors and more state and federal grants. Ppl should NOT be getting sent to state prison for fights and popping wheelies period. That is NOT rehabilitation, they leave with a Master's in criminology with no chance no opportunity only the choice between using what they now know to survive or not using it and being locked up anyway.

Powerful .. keep standing strong bro. This satanic white supremacy system will fall and those behind it will burn. God is on his Throne. America's justice system is a joke but Gods justice system ; Divine Justice ; it ain't no laughing matter.

They all laugh until they are sitting in prison for drinking and driving, or get set up by the cops, happens much more than ppl think....
