The female witness is a hero for stepping in.  Wondering what the other commuters were thinking?

Expected behavior from blacks. If you are disappointed in their behavior then lower your expectations and you will not be disappointed any more. Sad but true.

But they seem like such productive members of society. Not their fault that they got "dissed" by a blind man.

Ah Yes, more of Obamas America hard at work. Probably shouldnt have used Obama and work in the same sentence. My only argument is that they refer to these two animals as men.  im sure theyll get community service because theyre just misunderstood. Im going to run back to my safe space and hold my emotional stabilizing porcupine now.

I am sure somehow this is my fault because I am a white, straight conservative male.

Want to hear the worst thing a father could ever hear from his daughter?   

"Daddy, I want you to meet my new boyfriend Darion.  I love him and am having his baby."

And you know this because you are really Darion Jr.'s grandpa. 1st your wife, then your son and now your daughter is laying with black men. I understand your bitterness.

They will claim that they thought the blind man worked for the GOP and they were just doing what Mad Maxine told them to do

They won't get that.  One is a juvi, he'll be let go with a warning to be a good boy.  The other is only 18 and the blind man bumped him.   So, let him go too.  We already have too many of those people in prisons, so it would not be fair to put more in prison. And no one was hurt.

Not at all surprised that it happened at the station right down the street from the projects.  Then again we are talking about DC, it is all projects.

I love how Fox loves to fan the flames of racism and create fear among white people by picking obscure stories about a Black person while simultaneously dismissing the 300+mass shootings perpetrated by white males thist year. Meanwhile, AAs are succeeding like never before in American life including going to college in greater numbers than ever before, entrepreneurship and running and winning elected office.

The problem that it IS NOT "obscure" IF you read the DOJ/FBI stats 6% of the population (15-30 year old black males) commit over 60% of the violent crime.

The "mass" shootings pale in comparison to the hundreds of lives lost EVERY week in the liberal cities.

Black women are not killing anyone and white women aren't committing mass shootings. It must be a man thing, since men of all colors commit 95 % of all crimes.
