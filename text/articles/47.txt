Dude, come on. Critical thinking. 
Reread, and think about it it's a single sentence.

He is saying if Sgt Johnson's mom is upset her baby boy won't be home for Xmas and Thanksgiving to remember their votes for this. 

Your superior critical thinking in action again. Amirite?

Dave in your haste to show how much off a bigot you are, the post could have been a lot clearer.  And yes, when people try to bully me by saying that I am stupid or they act like they are superior, I will defend myself.

I sense that you wouldn't do that.  Amirite?

The money being wasted on this stunt could house thousands of vets for a year.

If so, they make up less than 5% of the mob.

The soldiers are clearly just doing busy work.  Putting barb wire on a 100 yd of fence when that fence is 2,000 miles long is ridiculous.   I guess it's impossible to get wire cutters in Mexico.

For what exactly ? Illegal immigration has been on the decline for yeas and is prohibitively expense. OH and our bridges are in need of repair while we're talking about infrastructure .

Good point.  Our infrastructure is crumbling.  I thought Obama was going to take care of that with his shovel ready projects.  Another failed promise of the Obama administration.  What is your source?  I'd like to educate myself.

You do realize that when you join the military you belong  to them?  There are military people all over the globe that won't be home for the holidays.  It goes with the job.

All Ive seen is a group of people legally seeking asylum under US and international law and an attempt to turn them into criminals by creating an artificial bottleneck for applying. Maybe you should change the channel away from Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham.

I saw people breaching a fence and throwing rocks and chunks of concrete at our border patrol agents.

Trump said publicly, three border agents were seriously injured in the attempt. Unfortunately there was no one available in real time to tell the public that this was another Trump lie. That's the best tactic, smoother Trump's lies with truth, don't let them breath and breed for a second.

You mean like the lying HP?  The one that is trying to scare it's readers?  The Border Patrol and ICE are essential personnel.  They will NOT stop working if there is a government shutdown.  Ever wonder what else HP lies to you about?

Somebody in the razor wire business making a killing. Just more of the decades old Republican shtick of exacerbating problems and then claiming to have the solutions.

Remember the caravan that arrived last Feb.? According to DHS, 2,000 of the migrants still haven't been processed. Why not put more immigration lawyers on the border to handle the workload?

What's your solution to the people who cross the border with false claims of "asylum" (94% are illegitimate), and then skipping their court dates to live here illegally? Are you OK with that?

Of course not; I'm just asking why not put more immigration lawyers on the border to handle the workload? BTW, where did you get the 94% figure? omeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen says that "The way the system works right now the threshold under law is so low that about 80%  pass that initial interview, but only 20% are granted asylum by a judge."

I heard a statistic that 6% were granted asylum, but of course that figure could be off. Thank you for the correction.

A static border position is not a good tactic. To protect the troops, Mattis has to make incursions into the enemy's camps across the border. This should be accompanied by tactical air support.

How much is this political stunt costing us?

If you want to know ow stupid this is ask the people of Columbus New Mexico. The town who suffered the raid from Pancho Villa that the Trump Administration is using to justify this nonsense.

Trump's Executive Order, actually Kell's order, giving the troops authority to detain people is a clear violation of the Posse Commitus Act.

Trump and Company seem intent on breaking as many laws as possible in their quest for Autocracy.

Come on Trump supporters. Lets hear the justification for a very very serious violation of the law.

I would think that if it were illegal there would be some state or person filing a lawsuit.  That's how the left like to govern.  By using the judiciary to legislate.  So, if it is illegal then it needs to stop.  Since no one has been arrested by the military to date, your point is pretty much moot.
