I'm not saying it's bad or they shouldn't. They can be religious and keep their status as a private school. Just stop taking money from tax payers. How dense are you to not get what i'm saying?

It is a bit ironic that right-wing conservatives who freak out about Islamic religious schools want to do the very same thing by pushing their kids into christian religious voucher schools. 

Jon Stewart said it best, "Religion, It's given people hope in a world torn apart by religion."

And our laws! A great book is "God vs The Gavel". It goes into great detail on how religions keep getting privileges to not follow the same laws as the rest of us.

You don't make the rules for the school. Parents send their kids to private schools because of the discipline and rules rules. He can always go back to the public school and try to get an education there.

Read.  This private school gets PUBLIC TAXPAYER MONEY.  Therefore, it's not entirely "private" and must adhere to the laws governing pubic schools.

Its simple. There is no legitimate reason for the rule, and its obvious purpose is to discourage black children from attending. Its transparent. Its pathetic. Its shameful. And its racist. The little guy looked adorable!!

As a public school educator for 29 years, I celebrated all my students!  It did not matter!  All were individuals who deserved respect and most importantly, love!  It is surprising what love for each, as an individual, will go to make a difference in this world!

I went to a catholic school and i followed its rules. One being a dresscode on haircut.

If you dont like the rules enroll somewhere else.
This whole issue isnt about race or anything its about following the rules or not. Just as what you would expect in an office.

Everyone here is leaving out the "Racist Issue" here. Have any of you ever heard about a religious order of color doing all these ridiculous things that they are doing with taxpayer money?

That organization would be rejected from the voucher program immediately.

Napoleon was quoted in a book of quotes I read years age as saying "Religion is the only thing that keeps the poor from slaughtering the rich.

It isn't the hair policy but the segregation policy.  Charter schools get to pick whom will attend their charter schools.  White only need apply.

My son went to a charter school with more minorities than whites and most of them Haitian. So you may want to research a little further. Great school, but I ended up just going private. His school was too secular for my taste.

Stop giving public money to Private Religious Schools. 
Also, even if I personally dislike Religion and am an Atheist, don't put your child in this Christian School, find another, or give him a good public education.

A school is only as good as it's principles.  This school fails badly!  I wonder what would happen if a white child with dreads came into the same school?  Yeah, I'm betting he would be enrolled with no exceptions.
