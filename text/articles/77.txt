ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE?!?!  Stealing is a crime and he should be in jail.

There are procedures for things.  First you get charged with a crime, as he has been, then you go to court and if convicted you go to prison.  Same thing with jobs, at least decent ones.  If you are accused of something, they make sure it is all correct before acting, thus preventing future lawsuits resulting from kneejerk reactions.

Thank you Atticus Finch.  I see in your legal studies you did not learn hyperbole.

And you haven't learned what a hyperbole actually is.  I am an English teacher, and I can tell you that you have not used one.

And of course, a public records search shows Edward John Abernathy being a registered republican.

That $900 cost him $91,112, probably 4 months in jail, attorney and court costs AND a civil suit for the $900 plus punitive damages. How dumb can you get?

Was he financing a new wing on his double wide? Or just going on a booze or meth bender?

That's just crazy.  He makes a decent living, and to throw it away for $900.  He'll be fired and convicted once it goes through the system.

I'll bet that Abernathy is a trump supporting republicans--lie, cheat and steal is what they do best.

Obviously a Trump supporter who will replace John Kelley in the White House.  He is the type of man Republicans love and give administrative jobs to. (crooks, criminals, wife beaters, pedophiles, perverts, dead pimps and felons).

I let out a sigh of relief when I saw that he was from my high school!

That being said, he should be fired and in jail for theft!
