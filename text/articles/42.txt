Get her well and deport her and her kids.  She entered illegally.

I have no doubt she made sure to fall on the correct side, am sure she was taken to a US hospital and treated "free of charge" and I am sure we will be paying for her, her kids, her husband, her parent, her husbands parents, her grandparents, his grandparents, her great-grandparents, his great-grandparents, her sisters, her brothers, his sisters, his brothers, her aunts and uncles, his aunts and uncles, her cousins, his cousins..............

Did I leave anyone out?????

See, if we had Hollyweird on our side, we could get a few of the FX folks to make a bunch of realistic "heads on pikes" and stick them on the border with a sign stating "LAST GROUP THAT TRIED TO ENTER".

Assuming Cut/Stab survivor costs of $15,000 this one case with LE costs will be over $20,000. Build that wall.

Yes, you are right.  But don't you know?  Liberals think "illegal" is a sick bird.  ;)

You wait, the lawyers are probably lining up to sue the our Government for not properly posting hazard signs around the work site, in English and Spanish.

This is weird. Why would she leave her kids behind? 
Try to enter illegally, fall and get impaled, kids are left alone, desperation comes in many forms. 
She got what she deserved. Now send her and her kids BACK!

"..the woman told agents she was not a part of the migrant caravan heading toward the U.S." But she is as illegal.

Asylum applicants should be required to undergo voluntary sterilization and GPS monitoring before being released in the US pending their hearing.

Refuse either voluntary sterilization or GPS monitoring and they should be required to return to their home to wait for an asylum hearing at the American embassy or consulate nearest their home address in their home country.

I'm sure the liberals will blame Trump for separating the woman from her children.Trump is a great President but he's not God.

"The woman told agents she was not a part of the migrant caravan heading toward the U.S." Sure you weren't lady. You just happened to be at the border at the same time 5,000 of your fellow countrymen showed up.
