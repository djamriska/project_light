Track has no combat experience..  His DD214 shows no combat badge.  This whole family is nothing but a farse.  I had her dad for a teacher in Wasilla, so I've know this family since the mid 60's.

The Palin  family of degenerates have no values, they are money-hungry grifters, phony Christians, serial liars, serial criminals.  Why isn't this menace to society in jail?  Are they waiting for him to murder someone?!

Ask Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA). She loves the Palins. Never to low for her.

Not guilty, for sure, Dude!

I hope this guy doesn't get stinkin' drunk and kill some girlfriend or family member.   Of course, it would all be Obama's fault.

He is only a "vet" because he was given a choice, military or prison, after he and some buddies cut the brake lines of school buses. Such a wonderful family to showcase the "family values" that Palin always natters on about. /s

This is so true!  The judge gave him jail or join the military. I lived there during Palins reign and it was broadcasted everywhere.

What a great Patriot, veteran and hero this guy is. Maybe we should release him to the bears so they can have their revenge.

Jesus. There are Veterans who are actually suffering from it. Don't let Sarah Palin cheapen it. I notice that Track hasn't brought it up. His mother does.

We're not conflating the differences, Joseph, but Palin deserves everything he gets.

Joseph, Track cut the break lines of the school buses BEFORE he went into the service to be a cook so his criminal behavior has nothing to do with PTSD.

Wow.  I don't think he should have been accepted into the military.  That's a really sick thing to do.
