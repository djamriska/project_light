Why did we NEED him here? Idea: only let people come here from countries that score high on a civility rating system. Somalia? Not so much.

"he did not receive "intensive medical care he needed.     What? He didn't have health insurance? But that's impossible. Obama said that EVERYONE would be able to afford health insurance in his program.

We're way over too civilized, this sub standard human being deserves to be dragged in a public square and then thrown  rocks until his death as they do in the cavern world from where he comes from.. Does not belong in modern society......

Take note all Jews living in the Twin Cities of MInnesota, Somalia Capital of America:

Quran Chapter 5 Verse 52 

Oh he that believe, Take not Jews or Christians as friends as they are friends to one another. And whoso among you takes them for friends is indeed one of them. 

Now isnt that a comforting thought? But thanks to liberals, thats what you have in America today!  Not religious practice and tolerance through peace, but rather utter hatred and a plan to destroy America within. So my fellow citizens, I present to you Americas Trojan Horse!

Maybe the Seattle Jews have started to arm themselves and the liberal Los Angeles Jews need to catch up

Well, the Washington liberals are certainly trying their best to keep the law abiding citizens from owning firearms. That should help the terrorists save on gas money.

You can't tell me that religion does not preach hate. Otherwise how would a Somali man garner hatred for Jews? Last I checked there weren't too many in Africa.

So, why are we letting "mentally deficient" refugees from Somalia become U.S. citizens? Is it a quota thing ?

Such a nice fella though..  I'm sure that his defense will be that "he is a mentally troubled guy", that's all.  Or, just misunderstood in some way.. Or, maybe just a bad hair day perhaps..

None of this is funny of course.  However, there sure is a pattern - and growing by the day..  Just look at western Europe and the UK...and MINNESOTA..

Another useless Somalia refugee. 
Probably still receiving food stamps and free health care. 
We must demand an end to the refugee programs that cost taxpayers billions, then give out free benefits day one.

We shouldn't say anything about this gentleman until we find out what kind of trauma he was subjected to in his native country.

I think his pirate days in Somali wasn't included on his immigration application...he had to change careers rather suddenly.

No matter what it was! Nothing gives this creep the right to hurt others, you sound like someone who would welcome him with open arms and hug him till he see's the error of his ways. Come back down to this planet and wake up!

I would think that at this point, anyone named "Mohamed" would NOT be allowed into our nation as a "refugee"...

I know a guy who had a PhD in Physics who came through the legal process and it took over 10 years for him to get US citizenship. We have such a warped immigration system.

I'd certainly like to see a little less talk and a lot LOT more action from congress. If they can't figure out what to work on, here's my list clear and concise immigration rules, build a border wall, and cut the geographical model for health care. Let me shop the country and buy what is best for me. Now get to work!
