I've always noticed that if they really thought that it was justified, they would always release footage immediately. They dig into his past to try to find something like "He once got a ticket for jaywalking, so he was a dangerous criminal"

YOu didnt notice this. You think this. But the reality is that evidence is not immediately released becuase it is evidence. Information is not knowledge.

I think this, because I've noticed this. If that body cam footage had him doing anything wrong, then the cops would have sent it out. People like you are always trying to justify shooting unarmed minorities.

He had a gun while police  were responding to a shooting it isn't unreasonable to assume that the guy with a gun was involved.

'Brandished', 'lunged', 'resisted'.  Just three more weapons in the police arsenal.

Be careful.  These people have no morals or ethics and will kill you in a heart beat.  Do NOT look for justice because there is none to be had in the state of Alabama.  It matters NOT to them that this young man was vet and fought for his country.  It matters NOT to them that he was the son of a police officer.  It matters NOT in the state of Alabama.

Deadly combination of racism and bad training. I wondered if someone was proposing solutions. Google came up with Campaign Zero. We have to do better.

How would the police know that? They don't do a background check on an incident like that before  responding.

As a gun rights advocate, I have to comment on this story.  THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE AND I INTEND TO MAKE MY VOICE HEARD.

First of all, the gun rights movement is much more than the NRA.  One of the top three gun rights groups - CCRKBA/SAF - has already called for a national conversation over the issue of legally armed citizens being shot by cops.  Given that black men have been the primary victims of these unjustified shootings, yes this conversation must include that issue.

As for the NRA, it is absolutely not a racist organization - as anyone who takes a hard look at the organization will discover.  The NRA board is currently about 6% black and the NRA, not ignorant of demographics is intentionally reaching out to minorities - who are the fastest growing group of gun owners and CCW permit holders.  So, why have they been so slow to stand up for legal gun owners shot without justification?  The problem is simple: Law enforcement represents a huge percentage of NRA members.  My guess, based on my time as a law enforcement chaplain is that law enforcement is over 10% of the NRA's 5.5 million paid up members.  As a result, the NRA tends to be very careful about criticizing law enforcement.  Too careful in my view.

If the NRA continues to refuse to address the concerns of minority gun owners, more and more people will move to the other gun rights groups that are willing to do so - and many of those who make that more will be "old white guys" like myself.

Didn't even read the article because I don't care anymore, just straight to the comments to bust liberal balls. If I was black this wouldn't happen to me because I wouldn't be engaging in illegal activity and I would be complying, most agreeably with Mr. John Law.

Why do they still demand body cam footage when even when it shows the shooting was justified, they don't accept the footage as real? Why not just chant their real feelings "LET US GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING! BLACK LIVES MATTER! EXCEPT THE THOUSANDS THAT WE MURDER OURSELVES!"
