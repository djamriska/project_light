At this time we are looking for a suspect described as a white male, 57, heavy build wearing a black jacket, blue jeans and a large belt.

Better?

Police were looking for a man about 5-foot-7 with a heavy build, and said he should be considered armed and dangerous.
Part of the description is missing.

HuffPost is developing a bad rep: the St.Louis PD specifically said a"white male". But HuffPost omits the "white" part. We have seen this many times.
