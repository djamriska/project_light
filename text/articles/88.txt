Wow.  Another whiny, senseless article about a perceived problem.  Does she actually believe that only blacks concern themselves with possible repercussions of their choices?

Really?  Every time you and your son go a to public entity you feel that much "pressure" to not allow him to take his toy?  Perhaps your glasses are a bit too tinged to see that a few times does not equate to every time.  Maybe if you just let him have his toy and if you believe you are being questioned then you address it; isn't that how change occurs?  But to teach your son to deny and accept every single time white privilege wins in every situation (even when it's not real) is a lesson in victimhood.

When I was young, we were never allowed to bring toys to the store for two reasons. 1) We'd probably lose them. 2) The store might think we stole them. Never did we think the store would suspect us because they're racists....

Im 70 retired US Marine Corp ( 1966-2004) I married in 1972 to a colored woman( thats what marriage licenses says) I am very white. She was one first to become an internist. We have one child, career military ( they went university before military) wife died in 1996. Her parents in 2010/2012 both in late 90s as a orphan , they became my parents. They as well were physicans , radiology ( good reason, they were black and it was best , no one knows who reads your x-rays) Most parents do not let children take toys into any store, not because of race, because they loose them and its hell to pay. In my opinion its how one carries self, dad was as dark as Nat King Cole , but walk into a KKK meeting and be respected. Yes there ignorant racists, but they not hiding under every rock, like many think. If one believes that then all from Middle East are terrorists.

I didn't let my children bring toys in into stores when they were little. It's called common sense. I also teach my children to respect and obey the police, because they can be dangerous if provoked. Also common sense. I guess those things would mean something different if I were not white?
I would not for one second try and argue that racism doesn't exist. But come on now, do we have to act like talking to your children about how normal people act is more than it is? 
And I'm curious, did this woman actually ever go to a store with a stuffed rhino and have a problem?

I struggled with this article. as a black mother and a grandmother I hear you. I feel you!!  But I also believe that not allowing you son to take his toy with him is starting a process of othering and placing limitations on what he can and cant do. It is also giving people who would make prejudicial and stereotypical judgments a pass when they should be made to confront their bigotry. 

So, I let my granddaughter take her toys in the store and risk being accused of stealing so she can learn how to handle herself when confronted with bigots; I never allow myself to be overlooked by service employees when its my turn, and when they tell the white person who is next in line that they will be right with them as if they need to apologize for serving me first, I laughingly tell them that everyone understands how queues work. I risk being seen as an angry black women so she knows its okay to stand up for yourself, and its even okay to be angry if you are not treated with respect. I never curse, I rarely yell, but I do make it clear that I will not be invisible or cower to limitations anyone would place on me. We belong in this space too.

As a 51 year old Black Man. I ALWAYS told my kids to leave whatever merchandise or toys they brought with them into whatever store we were going into. You dont bring merchandise INTO stores. I dont even bring other bags of merchandise into other stores. And when I dont plan my lunch run right and forget to get a bag from the 1st place and want to go into the second place, I skip the second place. Not because Im Black, but because youre just asking someone to be suspicious and suspect you of something. NOT WORTH IT!!! Put yourself on the other side of the counter, and act like you know,....you know?! This aint a Black or White issue, this is a commen GD sense issue. AND!!! AND!!! a lesson to your child that you cant just do what you want to do and what makes you feel good just because you want to. Drop the narcissism pick-up reason and common sense.

Lies lies lies and you know it. You must be living under a rock if you think thats how welfare works with the current administration but believe conspiracy theories as you will. Oustley County Kentucky is 99% white and 100% welfare dependent. And what are you so afraid of? That the entitlements you believe only belong to whites will be taken by black and brown people?

It was actually Bill Clinton who radically transformed welfare, not Trump.
