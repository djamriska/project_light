It's called wealthy, preppy white male justice. Hell,  in a couple decades he could be a Supreme Court Justice!

Right, because we always have to think of the impact on men to make sexual assault abhorrent. How about all of the women these men get away with assaulting right now, right here in this time.

We can do both. Unless you think its a great idea to lynch black men for daring to even look at a white woman. They murdered Emmett Till was fourteen years old and they murdered him for that. 

I'm completely with you on sexual assault. But when you disregard all issues except the single issue you care about, it makes you a crap ally. Oh, wait, lemme guess. You're one of those who think alliances are one-way streets?

Rapists should not be given plea deals.  They should get prison time and some sort of rehabilitative therapy before released.  Then, they need to be monitored by a probation officer.

What's the point of a sex offender registry if you're not going to register sex offenders?

They have to be convicted before they're given prison time.

Allowing him a plea deal is what prevents him from being "convicted". Weird how if he was black, his "plea deal" would involve hard prison time.

While the DA may be correct about the evidence, there is a certain odor to this.  I hope the judge rejects the deal.

Hopefully, to take someone off the streets so the next woman isn't victimized.  Of course that's only if the system works.  This case looks crooked.

Abelino Reyne, McLennon Country District Attorney needs to be recalled for  making this decision.  Hope Judge Ralph Strother is more intelligent than Aaron Persky.

Honestly, I never could figure out what fraternity has to do with Education of our kids. These useless frat Houses are destroying the peaceful lives of those kids by killing them from being drunk and raping their female Classmates. The other side of this debate is the fairness and the double standards in the Society when dealing with these rich and priviledged  kids. One set of rules for the Bill Cosbys, never mind his celebrity status
and another Ones for the them.

Fraternities are for meeting the "right people" from the "right families" who can later on hook you up to the "right" jobs.

Exactly.  You can go anywhere in the US, drop your frat name, eg. "I'm a Beta Boy" and gain immediate acceptance by the Greek crowd.

Nope, the victim had no say at all. They promised them that they have a strong case with more than enough evidence for a conviction and then two years later, poof, they say they don't have that much evidence. I maintain the DA had been compromised.

The rich getting away with a crime.  Shocker!  Not really very funny, the victim will have no justice if the higher court agrees with the plea deal, and most likely it will.  Her lawyer nailed it with his statement.

Again!  Enough already.  What does it take to send these creeps to prison.  Unlawful restraint?  What was his purpose in unlawfully restraining this woman, taking her into the woods?  I hope the presiding judge rejects this plea deal.

I really doubt they would since the DA have already agreed to the deal. This is all in the DA. Ugh!
