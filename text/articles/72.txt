He should get paid leave. Until the investigation is over. Then he should be fired. All he did was abuse his position. When police do it they get paid leave and that's it. All I'm asking for is equality.

A poor comparison between the private and public sectors. Most of the private sector doesnt have unions protecting criminals.

Mr. Hockaday's defense should be that he "feared for safety." I know I fear for my safety every time a cop is in my presence.

The officer probably didnt smell anything because they would have put a lid on the drink seeing a how he went through the drive thru.  My question really is why the coworker wasnt fired and charged as well.  They were complicit because evidently they knew what he did.

First, how did the cop not notice the taste?  Second, the kid probably bragged that he did it so they told. Actually, there is no proof that the kid actually did it.

Point well taken.  Was he fired and arrested on co-workers word alone?

i think it's considered White on Blue crime 
                                                                    
i'm curious what the possible penalty would be for spiking a regular customers's drink instead of a 'law enforcement officer'

Nothing. The DA would drop it. But you could sue MickeyDs. .

It was against an oppressed and downtrodden police officer.

And the cop couldnt taste the peroxide? Talk about burnt out taste buds. However, that McD guy should have been arrested just for 1st degree felony bad haircut... almost as bad as felony man-bun.

Yes, that seems rather odd. Every cleaning solution that I know of smells very strongly.

I used to use peroxide as a dental rinse.  You can taste it.

Striking out at a profession tells you where the state of the country is. This was stupid and criminal.

20 years for a prank seems way extreme. There was no way it would do anything but make the cop sick.
