If discuss your status really means arrest and deport on sight, then all this means is that those who have made themselves known, and who attempted to work with the system, were proven right when they went into hiding. 

The state of work with the system is... theres no working with the system anymore.

Remember, Melania Trump got a special rush through the system, back in the day - and her family recently did too. Funny how nice White People get a different set of standards than Asians and Latinos...

What does that have to do with being here illegally? Also it helps to have a wealthy husband that can pull some strings.

you just explained part of the problem. BTW if you want to solve the problem there are to things which are most important. 1. Treat them in a way that they are willing to cooperate (this does the exact opposite) and 2. aid their home countries in creating an environment where they want ot stay there. This country  has helped create most of  the problems but isn't helping to solve them.

1. If they go to the US embassy in their own country and apply, like millions do every year, they will be treated nicely. If they are given a visa, they can come, if they aren't given a visa, they cannot come. 2. Fixing their country is not our responsibility. We have helped them enormously and they get aid in the hundreds of millions every year.

I still can't understand how leftists celebrate lawbreakers while demonizing the people and agencies who enforce laws that we have on the books. Whose side are you on? Do you see how bass ackwards your logic is? Jeez.

Mixed views. The guy reported to ICE as instructed. Was he entrapped into appearing for an interview but arrested instead? Nothing is ever so simple as it seems! Especially when emotions are involved. Law enforcement in democracies must avoid appearing like the  gestapo; in actions or behavior.

I just don't get how fascists vilify women and children. Their OWN families came to the US as immigrants but now, somehow, being an immigrant is a bad thing.

Oh, yeah. Infantile selfishness and self-hate. 
I forgot.

Different crimes/infractions warrant different punishments. If Mr. Scout went over the speed limit he would be fined and his car insurance would increase. If Mr. Scout illegally entered another nation he would be deported. Do you see the difference?

Gary - he entered illegally. We should have a right to enforce our borders. He knowingly violated our laws. He should be deported. Name another country that allows illegals to stay with no punishment.
