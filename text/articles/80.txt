How the hell is he still getting paid!?!! Im sorry if you get arrested (for anything) and you are a police chief, you should be out of a job! If he had been working for a publicly traded company he would be out of a job!

Im shocked he was arrested.  They usually show their badge to a blue brother and wink, wink, nod, nod, move along now.

It's Alabama. Things are different down there. I've got family down there and they aren't even shocked anymore when things like this happen. It's a beautiful state truly, but the evangelicals really give it a bad rep.

Ever since the Arpaio pardon cops have become brazen.  Too brazen.

At the time, outgoing police chief John Mason, who had resigned to pursue another job, called Driggers a great replacement, The Southeast Sun reported.

This guy's judgment is suspect. If I'm his new employer, I'm thinking twice.

Was he a Republican?

Now, now.  Calm down.  He said he didn't do it and was set up by Clinton and those against Rump.   All is right with the world and he will get  a raise shortly.
