I wonder how much money drugs cost the taxpayers and how many walls Could you build with that money and far as rehabilitation for a drug addict forget it if the edict has been on hard drugs for any length of time there ain't no coming back the damage is done sure you might be able to get the edict to quite using drugs but the damage done to that person body and mind is permeant

umm,,   I think an argument over oatmeal is something that takes place between two rational people and ends in some sort of agreement.   the oatmeal had nothing to do with the crime except to provide the spark that preceded the end of a life in chaos.  oh, and she's a gem too

Obviously,  more people like this need guns. Go NRA, keep doing your thing! Guns are a right, who needs gun control? Any weirdo should own a gun!

It's not child endangerment to have smoked a drug with a baby in the back seat.

Okay, skirt the issue as you did. But according to law, taking alcohol in a house while taking care of a child, is not child endangerment. Do you disagree with that law? Apparently, you do. Crack cocaine is not alcohol and not something that people get charged with while driving, so you tell ME why you consider it child endangerment.

Well, my father always said if your woman doesn't scare you a bit she is not the right one.

Shooting somebody in the head over Grits...now THAT I can understand! Cream of Wheat, warrants a shot to the gut! But Oatmeal? Oatmeal usually gets you a knife stab to the leg, hip, or thigh...but never a shot in the head! Geeeze...whatever happened to time honored breakfast grain tradition!

Well, this might have turned out OK then. Two druggies off the street, and a child in protective custody. I guess oatmeal IS good for us.

We must ban oatmeal.  If we can save just one life it's worth it.
