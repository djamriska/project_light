This will give him an opportunity to work on being a better HUSBAND and a better FATHER?! if you're lucky to still have a family after this, I sure couldn't have him around after doing something like that!

"expert analysis that Schneider is unlikely to re-offend. "..................Right because his first crime was so spectacular, there's no way he can top it?!?!

Seriously. This could have been the practice run for something worse next time, when hell know what mistakes not to make. Leave no evidence (DNA), and dead victims dont talk.

This is precisely why Kavanaugh is being 'shoved thru' to sit on the SCOTUS bench. The GOP is about to teach women what's what and who's who.

I've been worried that this was blowback since I read an article titled "The Death of Macho" after the economic collapse.

I wasn't aware that a Grand Jury's four felony indictments should be ignored because you think the perpetrator will not re-offend. What about being held accountable for the actual crime?

This a joke and the AADA should be removed from office.

I guess this guy just needs to do his choking and ejaculating with an ankle bracelet on.

What a heinous set of crimes!  I guess the law in Alaska is waiting for murder before they properly punish him.  He could have killed the woman he choked! He threatened to kill her! He just might give them what they're waiting for.

How can anybody conclude they he's not likely to re-offend?  Was he given a miracle cure for evil monster disease?

The people involved in his assessment and sentencing are also sick, and are endangering the public by letting this guy walk free.  I hope Alaskans realize this.  I don't know if their problem is racism, misogyny or both, but I consider these irrational hatreds illnesses.

Physical contact with bodily fluid such as semen is not considered a sex crime in Alaska, according to the statement.

Ejaculating on somebody who is unconscious should be considered a sex crime, no?

If he was black they'd be calling for the death penalty and probably put him away for 40 years. But he's white and Alaska mostly votes very conservative... remember someone named Palin? So there you have it. White privilege and misogyny rolled into a neat little package.

It was the ADA who agreed to this although I'm sure a judge did have to ultimately approve it

Most men are not like this.  What is worrisome is that so many decent men close their eyes and pretend that this is normal. That is the part I do not understand. Maybe they are incapable of placing themselves in another's shoes.  Maybe they need to ask themselves one question: Would I allow my daughter,wife, or sister to be alone with this guy?

This is not the norm for men, unfortunately these types have been at the forefront lately.

You're crossing Alaska off of your list because of a sex crime by an insane maniac?  (eyeroll)

Not sure where you live, but any kind of sexual predator database search should tell you that you need to move.

Not because of the crime, but because of the reaction too it.  Bascially they are saying what he did is nothing, unimportant, a little blip on his record.

This insanely light sentence made no sense until we got the description of the victim as a 'Alaskan native woman.'   By the way, to the assistant DA who describes the loss of Schneiders job as 'a 'life sentence'.  You need to lose YOUR job, and then you'll know that it isn't.

I know, I cannot beleive he said that.  The woman is the one with the life sentence.  She will never forget this AND she has to contend with the fact the guy walked.  No jail time.  That makes it worse because it says what he did to her didn't matter.  What matters is how this effects his life and they want to make sure that he has as little pain as possible.

The only thing that would have made him a worse person, husband, and father is if he'd actually succeeded in choking her to death before he jerked off on her dead body.

He easily could've killed her. I've read where, due to swelling, a strangulation victim can actually die up at some point up to 3 days after the event. I have a bad feeling at some point he is going to do this again - and he is going to kill someone. He should've been put on the SO list so LE could keep a closer eye on him
