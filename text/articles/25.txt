He got what he deserved. You cant be in the business he was and snitch on the competition to the FBI. Its to bad he wasnt tortured. Snitches get stitches or end up dead in a ditch.

How ironic.  He murdered 11 people, and wished for a peaceful death?

Hmmm....I seem to remember this saying.  If you live by the sword...

He was beaten to death by two whites. You need to go back to school and study logic.

I don't think You got 0341's true sentiment ..... You can click on a person's history and sometimes it will clear up a seemingly ambiguous comment ...... see what else He wrote on race and the lack thereof .......

Bulger died a violent death after being transferred from a maximum security prison where he lived in safety in isolation, to a WV prison where he was dumped into general population and immediately beaten to death.  Why he was transferred has not been disclosed.  Why he was dumped into general population has not been disclosed.  What is known however is that Bulger had a long relationship with Bob Mueller and due to this relationship, and Mueller's protection of Bulger, four men went to prison for a murder they did not commit and the evidence that would have proven they were innocent was withheld from the trial by DOJ.  Ultimately, $100 million dollars was paid (your taxes) as a penalty for the wrongful imprisonment of these four men, two of which died while in prison.  The person in charge of the FBI at that time was none other than Bob Mueller.

BOSTON, July 26  In what appears to be the largest sum of money ever awarded to people who were wrongfully convicted, a judge today ordered the federal government to pay $101.8 million to make amends for framing four men for a murder they did not commit.
Two of the men died in prison after being falsely convicted in the 1965 gangland murder. Another, Peter Limone, spent 33 years in jail before he was exonerated in 2001. The fourth, Joseph Salvati, spent 29 years in prison.
It took 30 years to uncover this injustice, Federal District Judge Nancy Gertner said in announcing her decision. She said the case was about the framing of innocent men, adding that F.B.I. officials allowed their employees up the line to ruin lives.
FBI officials means Bob Mueller who ran the FBI and allowed this.  No question about it.

Thank you very much for the post!  I was trying to find more on it.  Alan Dershowitz has commented on it. I guess AngelCat58 sees little green men.

Too bad he won't go like JEFFREY DAHMER- instead of an "inserted broom handle" maybe it WILL be a "nine iron."
