I can't believe the waste of resources that goes into putting a diagnosed psychotic woman on trial three times. Once should have been enough, with enough funds left over for hospitalization and intensive care. This system needs an overhaul.

She must be really bad as it takes a lot to get an insanity defense through anymore.

We'd rather lock up those with mental illness than treat them and prevent a lot of problems...
