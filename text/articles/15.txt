A popular conservative news agency is boasting about this in an "I told you so" way, but didn't the system completely work here? Yes, bad people tried to hide with non-criminal, well intentioned people. They got caught. 

That said, I believe the well intentioned people trying to cross the border are wrong. They do not meet the requirements for amnesty either technically or in spirit. Of course these people want better lives, and not many people get to choose from where they are born, but that doesn't give them the right to just decide to force their way into another country. If they really needed to just get out of their own countries, they passed by at least one or two other countries on their way here. 

I don't think any of these people should be able to wait freely in the US while their proceedings go through, however there is international law because of horrible incidents in the past that the USA agreed to. I think these treaties and laws need to be revised to make it more than abundantly clear that amnesty isn't just for the people that try really hard, but those that are actually being persecuted and have no where else to go. This is already in the laws and procedures, but there is enough grey area to allow lawyers to go to court over and over in cases that don't fit the spirit and purpose of being granted amnesty from the United States. 

This is a bad and sad situation, and one that should be taken seriously but not one that should be used for political grandstanding by any political parties. Once again congress should be looking at and revising these laws before they get to this point. These issues have been being debated for as long as I remember, but what has changed other than poorly written presidential executive orders from the current and past presidents? 

Nothing changes, everything goes to court over and over and the only winners are the billing attorneys. Taxpayers lose on all sides.See more...

The media is going to help Trump get re-elected, Say what ever you wish about the man but by now it's pretty easy to decipher which comments are purely his own and which are the result of briefings. Opposing the latter every single time is going to get him re-elected. 
We all could have learned something if the LA Times had used its resources to give an in depth factual report about the caravan. The old LA Times would've done this and done it well.

For the purposes of 8 USC  1158, Mexico is plainly a "safe third country."

The longer these people stay in Mexico,demanding entry into the U.S and rejecting Mexicos offers;the more they show themselves as economic refugees shopping for the best benefits. Clearly they have escaped the threat motivating them to depart..then we have the villains.To watch network TV or print media youd think were the villains. 

On the other hand cheap labor advocates and liberals are salivating at the new means of acquiring uneducated peasants.The addiction democrats and republicans have to importing poverty is a shared disease reaching terminal velocity.

"It was unclear why they werent being charged with illegal entry under the Trump administrations zero tolerance policy."

Let me clarify that for you: because California has the ridiculous policy of being a sanctuary state. I'm surprised these men weren't given a welcome party. I'm sorry for the leftists whose feelings were hurt by these men getting caught, I know it offends your sensibilities that they were not given a royal welcome. You must be outraged.

As a Trump supporter, I must assume they're all drug dealers, murderers and/or M-13 members. Even the mothers and their babies. [Insert palm slap to forehead here.]

This is ridiculous! There are no criminals in the caravan but rather only women and children. This is fake news!! All of it!!!

Was our President correct then? Are MS-13 members imbedded in the caravan? Are there criminals imbedded in the caravan? Was the President correct about that?

Yes, he was. You may not be aware of this, but he happens to have access to intelligence services.

Yes, we sort of have to think that this guy is not the only one...just one that crossed and go caught. These hoodlums probably see a caravan as a good way to blend in and get into the U.S. without being fully investigated.

Glad top see these thugs apprehended. Trump is right - we have to stop all illegal immigration. only legal immigration will work.
Avatar
It would be nice if he'd let legal immigration work, but he's doing his best not to.
Avatar
Only if what you mean "legal" is getting caught for illegally entering and then getting an asylum hearing. Yeah he's trying to stop that, thankfully. Actual legal immigration is alive and well.

Mexico needs to send them all back. Why did they let them into their country in the first place? Did they think the U.S. was just going to let them pour over our borders?

Apparently that is what Mexico thought. Surprise!!!

Yes, because we have in the past.
