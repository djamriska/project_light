At some point exacting justice is impossible and if we torture we risk loosing our humanity, But in this guys case I might risk it.

What an outrage! How dare you call him a "serial killer"! That is derogatory and offensive! From now on they're to be named as having "indifferential living syndrome". See, isn't that better?

Bravo! 90 murders, wow soldiers don't even rack up that many kills. BTW, why isn't he hanging in the gallows? Not like he can be released without recidivating right? So why let him live when he's useless to anyone? That or send him to Syria with a Punisher t-shirt and an Ak

Most serial killers are white males because there are more white males. Per capita, its about even.

Everything I ever heard is serial killers are white men. Shows that racism keeps some killers on the streets if you automatically exclude anyone but white men for serial cases.

He's been killing for a long time, & killing thru all the decades that we were told serial killers were white males. I wonder what goes thru a serial killer's mind over the course of a day. Is finding a victim a constant obsession? Does he ever stop thinking about his next kill or his last?
