3 years is an absolute joke what with that  kind of power that this man had he should have been held to a higher standard and had to serve twice as much time as anyone he got illegally convicted.

The sentences were much too light. About 20 years would have been about right. There is no excuse in the world for this kind of thing to happen within our law enforcement agencies.

There is no excuse in the world for this kind of thing to happen anywhere, with anyone.  There is no special sentencing guidelines 'just for cops'.

How many years did these black men serve in prison? This ex-police chief should serve a year for each year that his victims served. He would have gotten more time if he had just held someone as prisoner  in home.

3 years?  Thats a joke.  This filthy criminal abused his law enforcement status to deprive citizens of liberty.  There should be mandatory sentences for government state actors caught abusing their offices or official positions & laws against violations of public trust.

These asshats wield unlimited power - the power over life & death, the ability to destroy a persons life & deprive them of everything the Constitution protects.  Who knows if these are the only people they framed?  Sadly, well never know.

There is no such thing as 'unlimited' power.  Every thing an officer does is reviewed endlessly.  Yes, they are given great privilege, but they have to accept great responsibility to go with it and if they screw up they have great consequences.

There does not need to be 'special laws' just for police officers.  If the laws regarding the violation of civil rights are too lenient, then change those laws.  As soon as you start creating 'just for cops' penalties, you are creating the exact situation that so many people think already exists - you are opening the door not only to special punishments, but to special preferences as well.  VERY bad idea.

And, yes, you WILL know.  You can bet your last dollar that every single thing this person has been involved in will now be thoroughly investigated, and many cases - even those that he did NOT do anything wrong in - may be overturned as a result.

BTW.  Its sad that police use of force standard in America against its CITIZENS is a lower standard than our military operating in active war zones - where theres an enemy who wants to kill you hiding within the population.

It should NOT be a lower standard for cops who operate in a more permissive environment, and whose citizens are protected by our constitution.

If cops, who are supposed to be trained professionals, cant operate within the same restrictive rules of engagement & escalation of force here at home as the military fighting a war abroad?  Maybe they should do something else that they are better suited for.  Just saying.

His time served should be equal to the time(s) those framed received, at minimum.

Double standard at its best. The sentence should be the maximum sentence each victim was facing for each victim. The left refuses to punish government employees or college educated or college students equally. Our colleges have their own police departments to protect their self-serving self proclaimed elites from crimes committed on campus property. These self proclaimed elites will never hold themselves to the same standards as they hold 90% of non government and non college educated Americans.

It is the exact opposite of a double standard.  The exact same standard was applied to this ex-officer as would be applied to any other person who violated someone's civil rights in this fashion.  You spent a great deal talking about 'special elites' and different standards, while at the same time arguing for the very same 'different standards' that you are claiming are a problem.

Cops are treated with the exact same standards as everyone else.  That is true whenever people erroneously claim they are getting some kind of special treatment; it is also true, however, whenever people try to claim they should get a worse treatment because they are cops.

Your absolutely wrong. I don't hate cops, I hate dirty cops and dirty government employees. When a government employee has special laws to protect them and severe penalties if you threaten, harm, resist. These same government employees should be held to the same standards. Colleges protect their criminals from normal legal criminal records. I am absolutely correct in my assessment of the double standard. A government employee has the power to destroy lives and a country.

This should be a life sentence. He violated the liberties of Americans after taking an oath to do otherwise. Disgusting person.

I'd like to know why he was sentenced to only 3 years, when the max. penalty is 10.  He will be out in about 18 months, and that just isn't good enough for what he did.

In my opinion, 3 years is a gift. I believe people granted authority over others need to have the book thrown at them. I don't tolerate this crap.

That is a pretty light sentence as far as I'm concerned.  This is perhaps worse than women making false allegations of rape against men.  It is worse because he is a police chief, a trusted member of the city government.  He should get 20 years for this.

I wouldn't be surprised if defense attorneys have already filed appeals on every case this "cop" was involved in. I wouldn't be surprised if some already convicted criminals end up going free because of this.

Detectives and City Attorneys have pressure placed upon them to catch lawbreakers.  A fear of losing one's job motivates many to falsely accuse innocent people.

He should have gotten the max. 
     Government and especially elected officials that do things like this break the trust of the people and are doing harm way more than just the people he put in jail. In order to guarantee the integrity of the police force everyone involved needs to be put away for a long time to let other officers know without the benefit of a doubt that this is not acceptable.
  I found it laughable that they seemed to think because they had a prior record that it somehow make it ok to target these men.
