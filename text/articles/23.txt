On February 14, 1929 the St. Valentines Day massacre occurred.  Seven men were brutally murdered.  The entire country was shocked and outraged.  Now four people are killed execution style and most people have not even heard of it.  Those who have heard of it don't consider it news worthy.

I would say give them the key to the city but they probably already stole them.

Excellent gun control. A single bullet each keeps expenses down.  It is also very safe; point-blank range prevents stray bullets which could break  a window or damage a car.

Employment of millions depends on them.  They are extremely valuable resources as prisoners.  Each person in prison provides good employment for 5 other Americans. A prisoner is America's most valuable asset.

This is a one sided story. There was no drugs involved. It was a home invasion murder and the victims are not alive to tell their side of the story

I do agree that these ultra liberal cities need gun control. Apparently they don't know how to control them with killing someone.
Maybe they need people control first.

Please rethink that. The last thing they need is gun control. How else do innocent, law abiding citizens protect themselves? Gun control laws are never the answer because criminals don't obey the law.

So take away law abiding citizens rights to protect themselves?  Do you really think criminals will obey those laws?

sorry but big pharma has created a lot of drugs that have saved a lot of people.   There are diseases we rarely hear about that need research...and that isn't cheap.

It would be great if these two repeat offenders were actually kept in jail, but keep in mind that Philly elected a catch-and-release DA last year who promised "progressive changes" to the criminal justice system. I''l bet $10 that at least one of those two gets released and hurts someone else..
