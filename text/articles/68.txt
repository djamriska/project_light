Guns make domestic violence much more deadly, sometimes for cops and innocent bystanders. Because, you know, bearing arms was a God-given right in the 18th Century, just like buying and selling slaves and denying women the vote.

I posted on here three weeks ago about a domestic abuser showing up at my work. He stood out front, high as kite looking into our business with the domestic violence victim working right behind me. I went to upper management to ask what is being done. I told them I wasn't happy with this situation. They told me if I didn't feel comfortable I should go home.
I went home and never received a call. I went into the main office two days later and was asked by another manager if I wanted to work in another building. I accepted, on my second day back one of the supervisors was walking by the building I was working in. He came in and gave me a high five with a big smile and said " I'm glad to see your back, I can't believe they fired you" I said this is news to me. He then said "three managers filled out paperwork on me, they said you had a panic attack and stressed out and walked off the job" 
I was shocked. I got fired for asking what our company policies are on domestic abusers showing up at our place of business. The company is one of the largest employers in the country and is headquartered in California. 
The man/domestic abuser was not supposed to be on campus the victim had a restraining order on him.
mangement said there is nothing they can do. I was also told by another higher manager "it's none of my business "
This is the world we live in.

Here is the problem with these posts: We already have multiple laws on the books that say "Domestic abusers who have been convicted in a court of law (key terms there are the six before this) are put on the NICS list and forbidden to own firearms without the approval of a judge!"

Question: Why the hell was this man not on the lists? Could it just possibly be that he was never convicted in a court of law of domestic abuse?

Now the whole "She had an order of protection against him!" niggles because some states do have laws that say "If there is an order of protection against you, you again cannot own a firearm without the approval of a judge!"

So... why was this not in the NICS list and why did the FFL in question not notice it if it was if the firearm was bought from an FFL.

He probably wasn't convicted because no one believed her. That's how it usually happens. Nine times out of ten the same people asking "why wasn't he in the system" are the same people who say "women lie to hurt men." Society can't keep claiming women lie, ignore the actions of male abusers, and then scratch their heads when the abuser finally hurts people.

The Constitution will be changed and most guns will be banned sooner, or later. What gun owners (like myself) think about it is not a deciding factor. It's a social and demographic evolution. Eventually, the votes will be there. Threats of violence, or actually violence over gun rights will simply speed up the inevitable, as will shootings in general.

This wasn't a 'mass shooting', and you can be sure that the criminal was already a felon with an illegal gun.

So you define "mass shootings" now? According to law enforcement definitions it was a mass shooting.

I don't understand  -- with his behavior issues towards females -- how did he make it through the academy?

He didn't. He was accused of aggressive and improper conduct toward females at the academy, Chicago Fire Department spokesman Larry Langford said. He was disciplined and terminated.

I knew right away that he wasn't a White male because most of the leftist news media didn't show his picture, i.e Huffpost, CNN etc.

Talking heads and writers know what butters their bread.  I am not saying domestic violence is not a problem but she is completely wrong.  Most mass shootings are about politics, kids that were bullied at school. racism and disgruntled workers.  Her income is based on women's issues so she has this point of view for financial reasons.  By the way most children and elderly people are abused by women.  That is also domestic violence but we don't talk about that.
