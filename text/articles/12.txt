It began as a dispute over funeral doves. It ended with Nazi memorabilia, guns and an arrest

Despite the above protests about Mitch not being a violent skin head, his house wouldn't have been searched if he hadn't made those not too subtle threats. It's illegal to threaten to kill someone, and when you have a lot of weapons to back it up, the police are going to take it seriously for very good reasons.

The crime is not possessing a picture of Hitler, nor the stupid claim in the article about how many guns a dealer might have, it is threatening to kill a man over a dispute.

I think that Laguna Beach Police Sgt. Jim Cota needs to get out a little more if he can say I dont even know of any gun dealers that have 50-plus guns,. 
Yeah, LOTS of gun dealers have more than 50 guns. Heck, a lot of gun enthusiasts have more than 50 guns. That does NOT make them more dangerous. After all, how many can they carry and use at one time? Three or four?
I particularly liked the "Detectives discovered several pounds of ammunition". 
Wow, so about 3 boxes of ammunition. Big deal.

I'm not even a gun owner but even I bristle when the LA Times writes that cops seized "rifles  some resembling semi-automatic weapons." Again, I'm not an expert, but doesn't semi-automatic just mean it fires every time you pull the trigger, and aren't the majority of rifles sold therefore semi-auto? She probably means semi-auto that 'resembles automatic weapons' like an AK or M16? Ah, forget it.

Guns and Nazis - Never a good combination.

Did the guy train his doves to fly in a swastika formation?

That would have been cool

*Listen you cheapskate, when my doves gotta p**p they gotta p**p. It would be a shame if something were to 'happen' to your car right after you washed it.*

Too bad the copy desk can't come up with a catchy headline based on Prince's 1984 song. I'm dating myself here.

I think the dove handler was owed his fee here. I would like to see the underlying contract, but he transported the doves to the location and was ready to go, so the man should have been paid. In the future, I would recommend hiring a professional debt collection service or small-claims court instead of issuing death threats.

One of the rare, rare cases where an NRA poster child was possibly deterred before going bonkers and killing people. So our leaders are spared having to put on somber faces and send their "thoughts and prayers" to the survivors.

The operative word being "possibly", unfortunately.
