The good thing is  unlike Normal people these Cops have absolutely nothing to worry about when it comes to keeping their Job and their Pension.

One of my co-workers was fired last week.  One was let go 4 months ago, and every time there is a new sheriff elected we lose 5 or 6.

Back in the day if you attempted to escape you were either shot or tuned up on the spot. I miss those days.

This is the first crime committed in New York in months. Amazing how low their crime rate is.

The cops must have left him in the unlocked car when they stopped for doughnuts.

16 priors, still free and menacing the community. This continued crime spree is brought to you by liberal judges. We do NOT need prison reform. We DO need judicial reform.

It's less about liberal judges, and more about lack of space at Rikers Island jail where he belongs.  Apparently he was seen as less dangerous than the ones confined there, because in order to put him in they have to let another criminal out.

A New York City black man in handcuff's.  You don't see that very often.  He should stick out like a sore thumb.

Well, they couldn't shoot him. That would have brought on claims of racism...

Obviously, he could run faster scared (even with his hands handcuffed behind his back) than the cops could mad.

When they catch him he can claim he was scared for his life. Because we all know police are out to murder black males.

The fact of his crime isn't even going to enter the conversation.
