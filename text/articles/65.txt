I am not shocked by this.  Women being killed by partners only make news if they are white (the woman and her daughters who was killed by her husband this summer made the news for weeks).  Dr. O'Neal's name was barely mentioned, we heard more about the cop.

What's more shocking to me is he only got life in prison, didn't read the article or searched whether the state wherein he was convicted have the death penalty or not, but to murder your babies and their mother because you want to screw some other woman is hard to fathom. What's going on in a man's mind that would make him commit such atrocity???

Men are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill us.

Well IMO men would open up emotionally if woman would not hold over our heads for life.

Stop being a punk. Sometimes a woman just ain't feeling you. Let it go.

Too much like Gladys Ricart. It's all jacked up. Just another nut who couldn't handle a accomplished woman moving on.

Yeah, the ex killed her on her wedding day, and tried to say that it was her fault during the trial.

With a history like that Juan Lopez must have done a real snow job on Dr. O'Neal to get her. And these types of men are masters of this. He probably hit her the "love bomb" technique, snowballing her into an engagement before she could get to know the real him. 

No matter, she saw enough and was smart enough to break it off. Unfortunately, she may not have taken into account the cardinal rule: women are at their most vulnerable AFTER leaving an abusive partner.

Agree.  Too much good sex must have led her to accept then flipped when the raw side him showed.  But women should seriously consider given back the engagement ring asap, it's not worth your life.  What a waste.

That was a ridiculous response. As if all there is to men is "too much good sex"....ugh. And that the only reason he went after her was she must have kept the ring and if she had just given it back, that would have stopped this from happening. 

Do you see how twisted that logic is and that it put a lot of the responsibility for this on the victim?

I am reluctant to comment since I'm sure there'll be those who bash me as being against first-responders.  I am not.  I have relatives in law enforcement, but also in nursing.

This article is spot on about the abundant praise first-responders receive while ignoring the other responders and the victims of gun crime.  Yes, first-responders are brave and deserve praise.  But take a look at a  #stayinmylane.  It tells all you need to know about the praiseless work of doctors, nurses and healthcare staff whose work is just as brave and potentially traumatizing.  

A talented doctor and a young pharmacy intern were killed in this incident along with the officer.  Each provided safety and healing from gun violence only to become victims of gum crime themselves.   Mourn them, praise them and remember them all.  Equally.

This was the first thing that came to mind while watching the coverage as it unfolded that night.

Three others died that day.  Four total.  Not one more important or more deserving than the other...despite what the media thinks.

The moment the shooting occurred, I was wondering about the motive. When it started coming out that it was a domestic violence issue, and Dr. O'Neal was the target -- sigghhhhhhhh -- I wasn't surprised, horribly enough. The LACK of coverage of her murder, at the center of Yet Another Mass Shooting, though, is beyond painful and tone-deaf and all the rest.  The incredibly negligent lack of reporting that could and should connect the dots, over and over again, about the links between domestic abuse and mass shootings angers me. The news media has a great opportunity to educate people about these links (like HuffPo just did, in this article)  - not only an opportunity but a responsibility.

women I know that have been told their new bf was abusive to his last gf blew it off as shes just jealous or thats only because she was crazy towards him. Not every women talks crap about her ex just because, and sometimes theres a good reason, listen to them. Abusers dont stop.

Even this article tells us little about Dr. O'Neal, how she lived her life, how she tried to get away, what measures she'd taken to protect herself, etc. Her entire murder is buried beneath political messages whether police killing (for the right) or domestic violence (for the left).

Womens issues. They always call domestic violence, (and rape, sexual abuse, harrasment, stalking, etc), womens issues although they are almost invariably men. The NRA and its minions in govt still dont want guns taken away from these perpetrators because, obviously, their right to bear arms is more important than the victims right to life. 

This is poor woman, a doctor working in the ER, working to help people and save lives, loses her own life because members of her sex, (and her race), are not believed, protected, and cherished the way they should be. 

How often do you hear that a police officer has asked a woman what SHE did to set him off? A preacher tell a woman that she took a vow and needs to go back? A prosecutor ask for or judge give a light sentence so as not to ruin his life? How often is a woman just not believed? Look at the White House alone?

I read about this story when it first happened. I knew it was sparked by partner violence, but by the way it was written I thought the target lived, and that the two women killed were bystanders, and that the policeman was killed in the line duty.

A good guy with a gun being killed by a bad guy with a gun story has much more appeal to a white media-consuming audience than the story of a black woman being killed because she was in an abusive relationship.

There was no clear-cut black vs white subtext to this story that would cause controversy and thus; sell more papers, interest more viewers, or get more clicks.

When it comes to making money in the media, black lives DON'T matter, it's all about making money. The obligation to inform the public has long past, we are now in an age of sensationalism and infotainment.

There is nothing masculine about that killing.
Toxic masculinity is not the same thing as toxic behavior and every crime committed by a man is not linked to masculinity.  This narrative needs to stop.

Um, this killing is kind of the definition of toxic masculinity.  A man who feels so entitled to a woman that he takes her life is often the man responsible for mass shootings which we, as a society, would rather not take place, right?  This narrative needs to be highlighted, as this article has done.  Deepest condolences to the family of Dr. Tamara O'Neal.
