Black guys smacking around their girlfriends is just their way of showing love . . . I love you (smack), I love you (smack), I love you so much (smack- smack).

Seems the 'Skins were looking out for his girlfriend's well being.  They saved her from an immediate beatdown for making him lose his job.  This gives him some time to cool off.

Speaks volumes on the thinking of who management is at the Washington Redskins....not everyone deserves a second chance or in this case a third chance.... especially for domestic violence...Foster is a threat BIG TIME..... all the statements the Redskins make do not mean anything, they are words.... Foster is dangerous....

And now, in addition to being hammered for their name, the Redskins will be pummeled for supporting a woman abuser.

Elissa Ennis figures she's been with the guy long enough to sue him and at least walk away with SOMETHING.

If he is convicted and gets probation will the NFL let him play? He is one of the oppressed and shouldn't have his livelihood taken away.

He's not allowed to play now. If found guilty, he will get cut.

If this was some isolated occurrence then there could be a chance with him. But he has history of violence and can not seem to control himself. He needs to get real help before his chances are used up.

Fortunate for Foster that the NFL lacks any type of ethics or integrity otherwise he would be in jail or dead. I'm sure his academic time at Alabama prepared him well for life after football. I seriously doubt Foster completed one meaningful class at Saban University.

No surprise here. NFL has been history in our house since they took a knee. What a joke this is, and they only waited two days.

Didn't the NFL once create a dude (monster) named O.J. with that kind of enabling/blind eye treatment? We'll see this cat again in about 20 years surrounded by a team of well dressed currency vampires proclaiming his innocence with a 'dindunuffin' plea...

Look at the movies back in the 20's/30's/40's/50's and women were smacked or smackin a man - plenty of men got hit with a skillet -  they would all have been charged with domestic violence -

Players "of colour" get so upset seeing statues of Civil War soldiers because it triggers thoughts of repression of their ancestors being bought, sold and traded by rich white men.  But they have no issues being bought, sold and traded by rich white men.

You do realize that they are getting paid by those White men unlike back during the Civil War?

So what level of income nullifies the label "slave"?  They got paid back in the Civil War also.

They have no association to statues but it triggers them.
