Gee... all those thousands of white guys in prison for murdering other white people would be surprised to hear this.

I wish I could return my ticket to the Trump World Amusement Park. I didn't realize my life would be on the line.

Not sure if the guys father put his gun away.  He probably was shocked by the remark.  As was I.  Im not a vigilante so if someone said dont shoot, I dont know if I could still shoot them.  Id love to be an avenger, but Im not sure how much God would appreciate it.  Or if you prefer, my own conscious.  I doubt the guy let him go because of his reason.  But who knows.

According to the anti-gun advocates, good guys with guns don't exist.  At least he, a white guy, tried even though he failed.  Kind of debunks the myth that all white people are racist.  Come to think of it, I'm surprised this article is even here

ahh... the vast majority of murders of white people are at the hands of other white people.  The vast majority of murders of black people are at the hands of other black people.  Those are the facts.

That's because the real estate industry segregated us long ago. Crooks generally prey on those they know or at least have access to.

There are actually quite a few to choose from. Don't forget that Trump keeps a grotesque looking bust of the "proud Indian killer" Jackson in his office; seen behind the Navajo Code Talker Veterans in the photos when he "honored" them.

Bet the GOP sure won't bring up THIS story when they hold their rallies and drum up fear over a caravan of poor starving refugees south of the border.

I blame all this violence on the leaders of government from the top on down.  The man at the top encourages violence against others at his rallies, though he denies it even though it is recorded.  Now there have been bombs sent to the people who have confronted him.  Now his followers state the bombs are fake and a Democratic conspiracy.  Really, those people live in an alternate reality.

So you're saying violence started when Trump got elected. Before him, there was none

And now we'll find out just how many violent interactions with neighbors and law enforcement before this, but never with him losing access to guns. Because, white man.

Notice how the media everywhere kept the core of this "Hate Crime" quiet. Didn't know the victims were black until I saw it here. Nowhere in the Milwaukee news was the story reported as it is here. "Shameful"!!

Out of curiosity, I wonder if Kroger is going to change their firearm policy... I mean I can walk in with a rifle slung (well no I can't, not without being gunned down by police), but if I go in barefoot I'm committing a cardinal sin.
