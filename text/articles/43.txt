The tear gas is only temperary dispersement. Permanent dispersement is shipping them back or to central of mexico. Prefer back and get the country to its foot by building homes or apartment away from the andrea faults and active volcano. And give insentives to better the economy and the raw resources.

Trump represents only 1/3 of the governing body.  How does he plan to get this past the other 66%?

Why not dig a trench about 25' deep, with straight walls, and about 40' wide?  It would cost almost nothing if we used the military to dig and reinforce it.

Theres a swell video online of a Honduran gang leader bragging how theyre going to take over and shoot anyone who gets in their way, the next part is of a bloody gang leader in the hands of one of the cartels, looking a lot less  cocky...

Require E-verify of all business, follow up and prosecute those who continue to hire illegal aliens.  The border river will soon become a trickle, I would imagine.  In tbe short term, close the borders and step up enforcement when the invading hoards become too much for normal procedures.

The "morning rush' are hundreds of workers going to San Diego to take jobs and under-cut businesses, increase competition, drive wages down , etc.  Not to mention take their earnings back to Mexico...
And we have 10,000 homeless here.

Shutting down the border would give a financial boost to so many....

""The U.S. government shut down one port of entry, San Ysidro, in California, for several hours early Monday morning to bolster security amid concerns about a potential influx of migrant caravan members. Most of the lanes were reopened before the morning rush.""

We have a clear view of the San Ysidro border day and night from our home in Chula Vista, CA. We thank God every day for ICE, our Border Patrol and our military for protecting our borders.  Even our Hispanic neighbors want these illegal migrants to turn around and head home.

countries need to take care of their own people first...that means the responsibility is NOT on the US or even Canada, it simply means that there are alot of governments out there that are neglecting their own people and living posh lifestyles off of them! THOSE are the people everyone SHOULD BE attacking! That is why there is poverty and struggling, you need to look at THAT SPECIFIC country's government, stop blaming your own country for the mistakes of another's!

If only Trump would put the same energy into fighting climate change... which is partly responsible for the deaths of 85 people with hundreds more missing in one area of Northern California within a few days... that he does into obsessing over immigration, humanity just might have a chance.  I don't know of any Mexican undocumented immigrants who have ever managed that kind of destruction.

i doubt anyone's naive enough to believe that everyone in these caravans are south Americans, or just hard luck, hard working families looking for a safe place to settle with their loved ones.& the last time i was in Mexico when i wanted to do ANYTHING there, they never failed to let me know i was a guest there & NOTHING ELSE, spend your American money and LEAVE. and you learn one thing very quick you NEVER talk crap about the host country. weird nobody in the world learns that about the USA- they want to live here, take everything they can-free- and protest until they get more

He is the only President of the USA who has the balls to do something about these invaders. Close the border with Mexico and let them take care of the refugees. They let them in, now you deal with them Mexico. You will see how it feels to be invaded by people who don't have any money, and all they want is a hand out! Looks good on them Mexicans. Close the border, and guard it. We are behind you Mr Trump!

if the border is closed, how are Americans going to get into Mexico to buy tequila for Christmas presents? How are American goods getting into Mexico?

Believe it or not, they don't serve you tequila at their bars and restaurants (Tijuana). What they serve slightly smells like it, but is some scary weird cheap stuff not available anywhere else....

Why does the border with Mexico not count as a border?  The U.S. controls, or tries to control all other immigrants.  I fail to understand why the residents of Mexico, or for many other countries cannot stay in their respective countries and demand and work for change in their countries rather than giving up and blood sucking by simply moving to good old Uncle Sam and much to the regret of wage earners in the U.S. that pay for these programs.  I totally agree, Mexico sucks unless you are a dope dealer needing a source.  Stop immigration and enforce the long established U.S. laws on legal immigration as they should be enforced regarding any other country.

He is the first president in decades to enforce the laws. He didn't make the law, write the law or any such thing. Then they cry because he is enforcing laws to stop this vermin.

America is a great country afraid to open it's arms to those in need.  That doesn't speak to greatness.  It speaks to a brittle fear of the other.  We need a realistic approach.  Listen to their stories and accept those that truly need shelter.  That is what a great country does.
