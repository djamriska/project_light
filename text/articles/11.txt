Woudn't these "migrants" be more comfortable waiting in their own home in their own country until their asylum paperwork clears?

Dear these are children, who knows if they have a home somewhere or not. Asylum as defined by law says they are entitled to file in the US. Durned those nasty law things.

Sweetheart, they can simply apply for asylum in their native country. Darn that logic thing. And just for fun, please continue to pretend the UNHCR doesn't exist and their native governments have no culpability.

The ILLEGAL part of ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION has got to stop! In the old days here (and elsewhere) people were grateful to get in to another country (legally) and then worked really hard at assimilating, mastering the language and getting their children into school and working hard in school. within a few generations, they were solidly in the middle class and contributing members of society, kids going to college, etc.NOWADAYS people show up illegally, put additional strain on our social services (which, by the way, they have not paid into yet want to get something OUT OF!) and then within the first or 0th generation start screaming and demanding for more and MORE support (free tuition for college, free meals at school for their 0th generation babies, driver's license rights, voting rights, etc etc) all the while they don't buy car insurance yet own cars and drive everywhere and cause accidents without being able to compensate for the damages, and they also use "anybody's" social security number when they get a job and cause lots of headache for the person who now has unexplained income on their taxes and doesn't know how to extricate themselves from this bureaucratic nightmare. The additional problems they bring sheer ignorance along with measles, TB, (other things that were mostly eradicated in the US but now have come back) along with the demands they make are untenable. We can't keep bringing in uneducated and ungrateful g.r.i.f.t.e.r.s. YES they are g.r.i.f.t.i.n.g the city, county state and federal government!  SSE

My grandparents (both sides) immigrated legally to this country. They had to wait. They made sure their kids did well in school. (they were not well educated themselves but READ constantly to better themselves and DOVE into the English language to assimilate along with their children)They made sure their kids were on the "straight and narrow" and did not join or start or participate in gangs (it was the Italian mafia where they unfortunately settled, but it's as bad as the gangs or the ethnic mobs here in CA). All the kids went to school through high school. Some went on to 2 or 4- year college, or trade school or secretary school, or started a business.. These were all valid and upstanding choices..then and now. THEIR kids (me and all my cousins) went one step further from the launch pad they provided us and we all went to 2-or 4-year college or trade school and/or started our own businesses. LEGAL BUSINESSES that operate ABOVE-BOARD and PAY OUR TAXES.I feel that if your first encounter with our country is an illegal act of storming the gates and sneaking in...and we continue allow it...and then REWARD it with after-the-fact amnesty...then the USA deserves its fall from grace (which we are now experiencing...faster and faster..) but I'm not happy about it. Wish our leaders at ALL levels could pull their head out of their collected "but" and stop this trampling of our once-great country.We are the next Byzantine empire or Roman Empire that was massive and in control...and then fell to the depths of destruction. SELF-DESTRUCTION. If the country could see a "therapist" the USA would be prescribed in-patient mental rehab treatment!See more...

Dear illegal aliens are not eligible for any social services so not putting a strain on them. Nope not demanding free tuition.

My grandparents came to the US as well. Nope didn't have to wait, just bought a ticket on a ship and got off when they got to the US. They didn't spend their time reading because they were farmers. Their children Well they didn't get in trouble but the children of immigrants have always been in trouble in higher numbers than children who were children of non immigrants simply because their lives were more complicated, they were poorer and their parents tended to both be working hard to survive and couldn't spend much time with them.

Ethinc gangs? Dear read some history. The US has always had ethnic gangs, German gangs in the 1840s, Irish gangs in the 1850s, Asian gangs in the 1870s, Italian and Jewish gangs around the turn of the twentierth century and well into the 1920s. The Mafia was at least as bad if not worse than the "ethnic gangs today" My father who grew up in Southern California between 1910 and 1930 remembered the Yugoslavian gangs of San Pedro. My mother who grew up in Texas between 1915 and 1931 remembered the gangs who came out to their small farming community in the Texas Hill country to beat up three different group. The immigrants, the black people and the "mexicans. The golden past where everyone was hard working and kept to the straight and narrow never existed. 

Weirdly enough according to the FBI immigrants both legal and illegal are less likely to be criminals than Native born Americans.

Illegal Aliens have been part and parcel of every nation on earth (Excluding North Korea) including the US for over a century. IT wasn't really possible to be an illegal alien before about 1870 and then only if you were Asian. 

Ah yes the once great country that is falling apart. Dear every empire and nation rises and falls. Did you believe the US was any different? The US was never the shining city on the hil. Like every other nation on earth it has always had elements of greatness and terrible disastrous horror. I would be interested in when do you think the US was great. When we were a nation whick had slavery? Was lynching of not just black people but Hispanic, native Americans and Jews the Great time in the US? How about when the KKK was marching? Perhaps the US was great when only the "pale people" could vote or even when just the "male pale people".See more...

"What began as an emergency, 30-day shelter has transformed into a vast tent city that could cost taxpayers more than $430 million."

"For each night a child spends at Tornillo, taxpayers spend up to $1,200 to pay the direct care workers, cooks, cleaners, teachers and emergency services workers."

Oww! Us taxpayers are getting played, big time.

Im center-right, Id say, on the current caravan articles trending now, but this is inexcusable. Incomplete background checks on (probably mostly) low wage employees who will be charged with the health and welfare of very at-risk children of all ages. The children have no say in any of this, they go where theyre told, by parents, unrelated immigrant adults, camp supervisors, and are completely at the mercy of all these adults, kind or otherwise.

They couldnt have called it Tornillo by accident, the name says it all. Screw.

Did we invite these occupants? No. Are they free to leave at any time (by accepting deportation, again on our dime)? Yes. Taxpayers getting utterly and endlessly fleeced by the onslaught of illegal aliens. If $400million annually isn't enough to flush away on this single facility, should we put federal employees on unpaid leave to improve conditions for these uninvited guests? Where in our budget would you like to slash to accommodate illegal aliens and the extremely expensive support, education, welfare, healthcare, and food that they collectively extract and defraud from our finite available resources? Maybe Newsom or Garcetti should field that question as it pertains to California/Los Angeles.

Dear these are children. They don't have the legal right to even make any decision, including the legal ability to agree to be dumped in some other country which may or may not be their place of origin.

Illegal aliens are not eligible for welfare and education, sorry that was decided during the Reagan administration. Food? Wow so we shouldn't feed children now. Ah yes our finite resources. Well whatever the US is short of it isn't food. 

Neither Newsom or Garcetti have anything to do with immigration. Get a copy of the Constitution and read it.See more...

It's really heavy on my heart, said Reynoso-Gonzalez. How did we get to this place, why do we have so many children out there?

Ask the Central American parents who do not use birth control.

Of course it's more expensive than a hotel. US taxpayers are paying for translators, counselors, food, kitchen staff, and security for this place.

It is nothing compared to the retirement $$ that people who leave Congress will get for the rest of their lives. At least some of these people will eventually get jobs perhaps in the U.S. and pay taxes and pay into Social Security.
Avatar
In the meantime, we'll be spending over $12,000 per child every year in education costs alone. Then there are the medical, food, and housing costs. Many of them will probably end up on welfare for the rest of their lives. 

The number of Congress members is fixed at 435 each year. That's nothing compared to the millions of illegal immigrants currently in the US and the millions more who are trying to enter/remain in the US illegally.

This is outrageous: "  staff up Tornillo without the required child abuse and neglect checks"

Yup lets put who knows who in charge of children. Child rape is going to ensue with the mystery employees. Heck they don't even know who they are, just might be illegal aliens.
