Yawn..Obviously the author was too close to the issue to be an objective observer. How much blood has his family shed for this country here and abroad ? Hopefully he will be replaced with someone sensitive to the concerns of natives.

"Hopefully he will be replaced with someone sensitive to the concerns of natives." Glad to hear you volunteer at and donate to so many of the Native American reservations in this country.

What a dolt. Trump wants "more" immigration judges to eliminate the backlog and process cases faster.

Who is the author attempting to fool? Sorry...we already know...ill informed, low information voters for fall for this nonsense.

Old enough to remember when resigning on principle was acceptable, even by those who disagreed with the principle. And 700 cases a year is more than 3 cases per work-day; that's not much time.

How long does it take to decide a case where the migrant clearly does NOT meet the requirements for Asylum/Refugee status under the UN Protocols or US Immigration Law? It probably takes longer to introduce the various people than it takes to decide the case. Over 90% of Honduran asylum claims were REJECTED by the Obama Administration Immigration Judges. 

Under UN Protocols any person desiring asylum is supposed to apply in the FIRST stable country that they reach. Under the UN Protocols and US Law, gang violence and domestic violence have NEVER been considered sufficient grounds for Asylum. 
These people are Economic Migrants.

He quit after only a year. Had he stayed on and fought harder to right the wrongs he witnessed, his words and actions would hold more credibility.

interesting to see in photo, that people are standing in line in an orderly fashion to see an immigration official . I am sure many of them crossed the border illegally jumping the line ahead of people who applied legally and have to wait 15-20 years to get to an interview for a green card. Isn't it ironic?

Neonazi Trumptards target these stories..it's hilarious to see their hate filled drivel. Even funnier that they think anyone other than their KKK filled jerk circle cares how pathetic they are.

Mr Clueless, you should look in the mirror. BTW, Giangranco, don't let the door hit you in the rear end on the way out.

If you are an example of the left then sane person is on the right.

Never ceases to amaze me how the left when faced with challenges to their absurd views have to play the race card rather than discuss facts. It's so over played....

Let's all thank this writer for his one year of service. It must have been incredibly difficult for him, but on the bright side he was able to form an opinion and get it published in the Los Angeles Times! It says a lot about the writer and the paper. He toughed it out for a whole year, which made him an authority. Let's wish him well as we accept his resignation. Hopefully someone on the editorial board will feel like resigning so we can have some diversity of thought every once in a while.

" .........administrative closure, which allows judges to put cases on indefinite hold, and which, in immigration cases, can be a tool for delaying deportation orders." 

You see, THAT RIGHT THERE was the problem- administrative closure was often used for people that had NO legal argument to remain in the country; and using administrative closure for the SOLE PURPOSE of preventing the factually, and legally, correct deportation was bad faith. Immigration judges were administratively closing cases as a routine matter to clear a large number of cases, and it's precisely for this reason that Sec. Sessions curtailed the circumstances where administrative closures will be allowed. 

I wonder if the author will admit that had those administratively closed cases actually gone before the judge, the vast majority of those cases would have ended in a deportation order (the technical term is a "removal order"). 

If the author was content with administratively closure of immigration cases and leave such cases in permanent "limbo" so that an alien with no legal right to stay in the country can indeed stay in the country, then he was, for all intents and purposes, an advocate, and NOT a civil servant, who is supposed to be dispassionate about government policy. 

And given that the author was the "attorney-advisor" for the Immigration Court in L.A., and who, I presume, is competent in immigration law, then he must know the majority of asylum cases in general are denied, and Central American asylum rejection rates are even higher than the average rate. This has nothing to do with President Trump, as the rejection rates were just as high under President Obama, and more to do with the blunt fact that most asylum seekers are not able to meet the legal requirements of asylum.See more...

Being anti-freedom is not a good argument. Most Americans will admit they approve of freedom for all people. Lincoln said that the union of mankind was the goal.

The migrants are free to migrate to any country that wants them, but not the USA. 
How are you confusing these cases with "freedom"?
