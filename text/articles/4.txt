Yarber was pronounced dead at the scene while a 23-year-old female passenger was airlifted to a trauma center with multiple gunshot wounds.

Were the officers cleared for shooting this passenger? Not discussed in this story. Was she the person who jumped out of the car?

I think Yarber would have been charged with crimes related to her being shot, because it's his fault the officers had to use their firearms to stop him.

Sounds like Diante had a promising future that was stolen from him as well as three children he was devoted to. I think it's time for the city to pay up.
