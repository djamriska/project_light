Don't worry, these people are thousands of miles away and they're ALL harmless.  That's what Obama said.

It's like saying you won't let me come into your house so I'm going throw rocks at you and break down your door. Who would want anyone who behaves like this in their home or country. No one, that's who.

Anyone, that thinks you are wrong with this opinion please forward you address to these post as an offer to house, feed and care for these illegal persons. Who would t hen be waiting for judgement of staying.  But, beware if they did not appear for trial you are then responsible for their financial being for life.  By the way this is what you are offering  all citizens of US.

I don't know why the caravan didn't just go to Venezuela. It's a lot closer walk and Venezuela has much more Socialist/Communist advantages than they'll ever get in Trump's U.S. Until we Democrats get full control we won't be able to match the compassion available in the Soviet Socialist Republic of Venezuela.

The US is blocking the border at Tijuana but illegals are still flooding the rest of the border. We need a wall. How much does all this man power cost? A wall is good for a long, long time just look at China. Haha

China's wall doesn't keep people out. And it never kept small groups out, just armies. Not to mention it was never completely guarded, ever.

The East German wall I was patrolling had a pretty good record of keeping people in. Seems to me we could use it to keep people out.

The democratic communist claim we need to let the caravan through the border. The way I see it they want them in to pay low wages and be the servants to them and their party, slavery is coming back. They come in the ones that find a job will work for democratic party as slaves $2.00 a day, a place to sleep and free meals all we ask is you vote for democrats for government because if you dont you can't stay.

Geraldo Rivera, you don't live amongst these people as some of us do.  You don't know what you speak of.   You don't know about the inequities, you live high on the hill.  I have seen too many Americans struggle while others, such as these, mosey on in and reap the rewards that they don't deserve.  President Trump has said America and Americans first; I hope he sticks to his guns.

There's a reason 70 percent plus people are against these types of entries and support what's being done. The other 20-30 percent either hire these people and make illicit money from them, gain political support, or live high on their hills as you said.

I've no doubt that Mr. Rivera is passionate about this, however, where was his passion at 20+-million- illegal-aliens ago!  He has a celebrity platform, what has he done to deserve to jump on his soapbox and denounce what President Trump is trying to accomplish.  His arguments on behalf of these people are very annoying.

Arrests. Charged with a crime. Due process. 

Why is that so hard for you to understand? It is in the Constitution according to the Supreme Court. Hire more judges and get 'er done.

I tell you what. If the liberals want them to come across, then let the liberals run in to Mexico.or any other country and if you get to live there without going thru the process, then I am with you., but going to many other countries with names you cant pronounce. I am sure I will win the bet. I would start with Islamic nations, then Africa and end with Mexico. Good luck.

Obama used pepper spray not a chemical that is actually banned for military use in just about every country in the world. The gas Trump used is known to have fatal side affects.

The gas used was (2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile) CS gas is an aerosol compound considered a chemical weapon that has been outlawed on the battlefield by nearly every nation on Earth, including the United States. "Chemical weapons such as CS gas are indiscriminate and uniquely terrorizing in their application, which necessitated their ban in combat in 1993, said Kelsey Davenport, director of nonproliferation policy at the Washington-based Arms Control Association." (WaPo 11/26/2018)

Left this out:  "But as a riot-control agent, 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile is legal to use by both police and federal authorities in the United States and many other countries.

and this:  You could actually put it on your nachos and eat it, Fox guest says of gas used at the Mexican border]
