God Bless Your family. Officers in Arizona I truly wish you would consider not responding to calls as quickly.
It's clear how the people of Arizona feel about respecting men and women that risk their lives daily.
The people of Arizona do not deserve law and order. The Taliban are the true leaders in Arizona. Sad but true.

When issuing a warrant, call out for the person to come out backwards and hands behind head. Do that 3 times before sending in smoke, tear gas..

The increase in police killings began under Barack Hussein Obama. He had no respect for law enforcement and had no problem showing it, and I might add, encouraging the same.

Unlike trump. Who has not done one positve thing for vets. He is against their proposed pay raise, he has lied to and disrespected the military more than anyone in history. What did he do on vet day? Memorial day? Labor day? He doesnt even know the national anthem or pledge of allegiance. No bible verses, he cant even color the flag correctly.  FACTS!! He also is a draft dodger.

Get your facts straight. President Trump did more for our vets and military than Obama did in 8 years. He gave his Q2salary to be used to help Veterans transition from military life to the private sector  as entrepreneurs.  Yet many easily forget what other Presidents have done! Oh wait, no other President has ever donated their salary! . You are not  doing your homework and do not know what Our President is doing to help America!!  WORD

Shooting and killing any law enforcement officer should be quick death penalty, no appeals.  Don't care how bad the shooter's childhood was -- deserves to die.

Just as I predicted the increase in cop killing is happening under Trump. Even though when it came to cop killing He said"IT ENDS NOW!"

If people want this cop killing to stop what needs to happen is, if you kill a cop (or simply wound one, doesn't matter, the intent was to kill) they will hunt you down, find you and start shooting until you are dead. No negotiating, no waiting for a killer to come to their "senses". They've already proven they will not hesitate to kill more. Just start shooting and keep shooting until they are dead, no waiting for a SWAT team to show up, no waiting for some "negotiator", no thinking on the killer's part "Even if I get the death penalty I'll probably die of old age first". And this policy takes away all the asinine screams of racism or racial privilege, everyone gets treated the same way. I think you'd see a dramatic drop off in LEO's being shot since word of this policy would spread faster than a California forest fire.

So you are expecting criminals to be rational and forward thinking?

First off, this is not about simple "criminals". It's about people who will shoot an LEO in order to evade capture or arrest. There's a world of difference. Now to your point. At first they won't get it but eventually they will as cop killers start driving down the entrance ramp on the highway to hell instead of a prison cell. At the very least it will insure that they never kill another officer, or anyone else, again. You're mistaken in your assumption regarding rational thought by assuming these killers are too stupid to understand certain death.

Your giving most of them way too much credit for actually thinking morally, or logically about what they are doing in the first place, or the ones that are in metal distress who lack the ability to think rationally at all.

This perp is a 2A hero.  The authorities came to his castle and he gave the officer the traditional 2A sendoff.  This is exactly what guns are for - the NRA and 2A advocates remind us.

You really are sick!  Someone needs to check you out. I believe in The 2nd Amendment. The NRA advocates do not represent what you are saying.  Sick!

You do realize that a fair number of people in law enforcement are NRA members and that the NRA has for many years provided courses specifically for law enforcement as well as other support activities. Most NRA folks take dim view of this individuals actions as it gives law abiding citizens who own firearms a bad reputation. The same as is true with say all those of a certain ethnic or religious affiliation are bad just because one individual committed a crime.
