She actually held office for 4 years on city council, 6 years as mayor, 1 year on the oil and gas commission, and 3 years as governor.  A bit more impressive than your stint as cashier at McDonalds.

Keep in mind folks that Sarah just didn't see this reaction coming...!**

**For the hard of understanding, this is a teaching example of lack of self-awareness, prominent now in the dexter caucus in US politics, but at least she didn't reach Presidential level...

Yet you like and support an elected official to congress who is a socialist, who called the 3 branches of government "chambers" and who doesn't even know that the 3 branches are the executive, legislative, and judicial. Something most 8th graders know, or at least used to. 

Who cares about Palin? She is history. The real threat is lazy young socialists thinking the govt is the answer to everything and not understanding that there is not enough money to pay for their pipe dreams. 

Wake up and recognize the real threat.

You sound easily panicked...  ...and prone to stereotyping...  ...and to unthinking labelling...

Ocasio-Cortez is on a steep learning curve and certainly will have from growing experience to deal with the 'art of the possible', but universal health care isn't solely an issue for left-of-centre governments. 

For example, Austria and UK both have right-of-centre governments, but also support, with a degree of reluctance, universal health care systems nationally.

If you hadn't noticed, Palin introduced herself into the issue, and so it is legitimate to remind ourselves not only how gaffe-prone she was, but also the rabid support for her becoming McCain's running-mate. Fine, you can dismiss all of that, but the corollary is that you also have to dismiss parallel right-wing circumstances today...

Wretched excuse for a female VP candidate springs up again. First time I can remember since $aint $arahs Sons latest domestic violence incident. And is to broadly mock a woman 500 times as good as $$. Oops, bombed as a comedienne.

My favorite was when Charlie Gibson asked her what she thought of the Bush Doctrine -- it was immediately apparent that she had no idea what that meant, so she panicked with a pathetic comeback asking, "In what respect Charlie?"

Exposed as a fraud with no shame or moral compass.

While you are still stuck in the past dwelling on Palin, who no one cares about except for apparently the mentally ill left, you just elected a woman TO CONGRESS who despite having a university education, who does not know what the 3 branches (NOT CHAMBERS) of govt are and who wants to spend $50 Trillion dollars on new social programs by stealing money from those who earned it and giving it to those who didnt earn it. And you think Palin was dumb and and was a fraud? Hilarious...and so sad.

So does your comedy include adding $32 Trillion to the national debt by having medicare for all like Cortez wants? Along with trillions more for other free stuff? Who is supposed to pay for that? The real comedy and tragedy is that an elected member of congress does not even know what the 3 branches of government are and that they are called branches and not chambers. This is a university educated person? Now that is as hilarious as it is sad.

Billy, you are part of the comedy. You partisan blindness allows you to not be able to see that the Republicans just buried us in debt giving more riches to the wealthy why you whine about programs to the middle which will be paid for many times over by their investment in our future. Damn, damn,damn.

Dont worry about Palin. She is history. DO worry about a woman who is university educated and an elected member of congress who doesn't even know what the 3 branches of govt are, that they are not called "chambers", who wants to steal money from those who earned it and give it to those who didn't, and wants to add tens of trillions of dollars to our national debt to give free stuff to any lazy person who wants it so they don't have to work for it. Now that Binky is a serious problem.

Ah sweetie, justify the huge tax cut given to the richest among this compently and then come back and cry that we are taking care of children, the elderly, and veterans.  Your concept of the beggar class is simply wrong.  As for the welfare state, go look at the whites only trailer parks in most republican states. Go back and balance why the states who are the most conservative are  the poorest and least educated.  Now there are some valid talking points not someone who made a simple mistake.

Sarah Palin needs to just shut the Hell up and worry about her own family.  You can tell she wasn't home much raising her kids.  She is irrelevant at this point and will do anything for a little publicity.  Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez can mop the floor with old Palin.  In 28 years Ocasio-Cortez has far more intelligence than old Sarah will garner in her lifetime.  Palin is just another hack who will do anything for a buck.  Todd won't go get a real job, and her son is too busy beating women up to earn.  Palin is still way out of her league.  Too bad she doesn't just walk on over to Russia and stay there.  They like people like her over there.  Stupid enough to be manipulated and making up their own facts rather than doing anything for the good of our country.

Thanks for the laugh! Palin was dumb, no doubt, but Cortez just called the 3 "branches" of govt "chambers" and thought they were the "presidential, congress. and the senate"!!! Instead of the executive, legislative, and judicial! And this is a woman who just got elected to congress???

Oh wait, I just realized that YOU probably didnt know the 3 branches were called or that they are called branches either! Hilarious!

Do you have anything other than she said the 3 branches of government. After the fifth or sixth times that argument grows a little stale. I guarantee I could come up with more than one thing Palin said that was wrong.
