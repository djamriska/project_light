If it looks like a turd, smells like a turd and is surrounded by turds it's most definitely a turd....and when I say surrounded by turds I mean the other political corrupt idiots Huizar calls his "friends"

Corrupt Democrat taking money for "favors"? Nah, it couldn't be... LOL

FBI should check all the city council members. Mark Riddley-Thomas, Gil Cedillo, Richard Alarcon, Alex Padilla, Herb Wesson. They probably did some "favors" too.

Did the LA Times just write a lengthy article about a politician with a serious ethics and/or corruption problem without ONCE mentioning what party he belongs to? 
I guess that means he must be a Democrat.

More corrupt Dimwit Party members are being removed. Conveniently, this information is released after the elections.

Typical Democrat behavior. Look into any given Dimwit Party member and you are bound to find graft, larceny, corruption, etc. Degenerate behavior is a core aspect of a Dimwit Party member.

This whole thing reeks; elected officials who take advantage of their positions like this need to be dealt with severely. Severely.

Typical LA politician. He will get away with no punishment based on past investigations.

The picture says alot. It reminds of the Seinfeld Schmoopie episode. Except they're looking at other seemingly thinking : "Your'e crooked, no your'e crooked" We're crooked! Like "can you believe these people here trust us"? Cha-ching.

Any organization, school or person connected to the Catholic Church of Pedophilia is the absolute LAST source you should be accessing for defining the "right path" to an ethical life or when developing your moral character. I am amazed how anyone is still so stupid as to keep "believing" in Catholicism and their obviously twisted and hypocritical principles. Wake up people!

Donald Trump is Presbyterian. He does not appear to be living an ethical life. He has no moral character. And he has twisted and hypocritical principles. How idiotic would it be to describe all presbyterians in this manner. Your an absolute idiot!!!

A politician will spend the tax payers' money as they see fit. It's not their money, so why should they care?
