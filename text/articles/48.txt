That you would call a natural, biological function an "attack" speaks volumes about your approximation to reality.

Wilson was arrested and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon without intent to kill.

Was she not charged for wielding the knife?

Without intent to kill? She pulled out a knife for gods sakes. If she didnt have any intent at all it would be with her fists... Not producing a weapon

So she had no intent to kill, according to the charges.

Query: How does one gut someone or something without killing it?

Wouldn't gutting someone out be an intent to kill?

Weird. People with teardrop face tattoos are normally so polite.

Maybe it just popped out and she couldn't control it.  Not like she was aiming the fart at him on purpose.  Sometimes you're on the bridge when it collapses.  He was on the bridge.

Not sure what is proper etiquette and how to respond when a stranger farts next to you in a public area. Do you complain? Do you move away? What about when someone farts in an elevator and stink up the joint?

For anyone who thinks this is a new idea, please read up on the Mulford Act, where open carry was abolished in California as a response to Black Panther members doing armed neighborhood watches.
