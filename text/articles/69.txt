Poor  helpless little girl. I hope she recovers both physically and mentally. Plus I hope someone picks up her babydoll out of the street. She's probably scared and really missing her dolly.

Local regulation is usless, when someone can pick up a gun, next door, and walk into a "gun free zone". We MUST HAVE FEDERAL REGULATION!

Where the F is that "well regualted militia"?  Shouldn't they be patrolling the streets for "illegal firearms"?  Oh right, they are all legal, until they are not.

Maryland has some of the toughest gun control laws in the country. The problem in Baltimore  is that the politicians there so demeaned the police they do nothing.  There are open air drug markets, shootings and mayhem. Nothing is going to change until the people living there decide they are tired of seeing these kinds of incidents.

Why is it when a police officer shoots and kills someone we blame racism and the cop, but in civilian shootings we blame the gun?

I am so glad you asked!!!

Because cops are supposed to protect us and civilians are not supposed to shoot people. If civilians didnt have guns, they would have a harder time murdering innocent people. Just like in every other first world country.

Of course, sane rational facts will not fit your world view though so I am sure you will disagree.

Because cops carry guns to defend and protect (yes I know it does not really work that way) civilians have no need to carry guns except at a shooting range.

The right wingers go ballistic over any type of common sense gun law legislation. So why not put a severe irrevocable penalty for anyone that is in possession of or using a firearm in the commission of any crime?  This would allow the gun people to have their guns, no second amendment threat, but, use one in a crime, BAM - life in prison or death penalty.

Not sure that would work, because everyone using a gun thinks that they won't get caught.

Maryland has some of the toughest gun laws in the nation.  There are stiff penalties for the use of a firearm while committing a crime. But the justice system is a revolving door that out of some sick sense of social justice just lets these clowns back out to prey on the very people the politicians say they want to help.

Horrible.  I'm so glad that this child is going to make a full recovery.  What are the city officials doing about this issue?  Maybe the citizens need new leadership.

Decriminalize all illegal drugs and treat addiction as a medical issue and this inner-city nightmare would end overnight.

The only reason we continue the same failing war on drugs is because people make money off it.

The level of self hate and worthlessness that turns into anger toward others is epidemic.

A country can only measure its prosperity when such acts are reduced and our innocents are safe.
