I think he was x military and had a permit..he might have been following the shooter when the cops saw him and killed him

Earlier, we stated that Mr. Bradford brandished a gun, the statement posted to Facebook said. To clarify, the word brandish was used because Mr. Bradford had a gun in his hand as police officers responded to the active shooter situation between mall patrons.

He wasn't brandishing a gun in the legal sense. This article is either misleading or operating on outdated information.

Let me understand this....the victim was "brandishing a gun when the cops showed up???"   If that is true we shall see in the released tapes.  If he was holding a gun when the cops got there, did they ask him to drop it?  Seems like a lot of questions need to be asked, but at the same time what is being ignored here is the other story; a criminal shoots two people at a mall, including a 12 yr old. What was his race?  Does it matter?  Jesse Jackson seems to think everything is about race. He is right. Blacks commit way more violent crimes proportionate to their percent of the general population.  Way past time to address that problem in the black community.

The problem of black violence stems from the fact that for many years up until more recent times they were systematically herded into sections of the city where they received poor education and had nothing but gun stores and liquor stores on every corner.

Reading the comments here certainly shows why people felt the need to kneel in protest.  Emantic Bradford Jr was legally carrying with a concealed carry license and pulled his gun in response to an active shooter.  He was shot in the head by police.

Brandishing or drawing, it doesn't matter.  Showing a gun at a shooting in front of cops is not a good idea.

Yes we did.  We felt sorry for a guy too lazy to learn the responsibility of carrying a firearm or the rules for drawing a weapon in a public place. Ignorance will get you killed.

So see how it works, and let us all kow. Confront a police officer with a gun in your hand, at a shooting. Use a go-pro so we can all watch your ignorance on display.  Bet you voted "D" didn't ya?

A counterexample doesn't negate a trend. Cops are the only demographic for whom grand juries usually don't recommend charges and juries usually don't convict. Juries assume the best of cops and they and prosecutors tend to lower the bar for them instead of raising it. That extends to all criminal behavior sadly, not just shootings.

Such amazing comments from the Fox News denizens here. A white man in the same situation would elicit 2nd Amendment right posts. But a black man....its no sympathy. How do you people even doubt that there isnt a resurgence in racism in America?

Dont you get it? The police do not protect & serve citizens - they serve & protect the state.  Shooting of innocents, even if they are mistaken, are acceptable & justified with very little redress.  

As long as they had a reasonable expectation that the information they are acting on is correct as they perceived it, the shooting will be justified.  The law favors the police - they have absolutely no duty to protect citizens.
