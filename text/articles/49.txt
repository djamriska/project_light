Totally agree with Marc. If you're for human rights then it shouldn't matter if you're Jewish or Palestinian.  Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

Racism?  Like shooting to kill Palestinian children?  That kind of racism, the genocidal kind Israel's war criminals practice?

Except that Trump thinks CNN sucks because they criticize his terrible personal profit first policies.  In this case, CNN sucks for bowing the lobbyists and Israeli propagandists.

What he said was not antisemitic any more than kneeling in silent protest being anti-veteran.

The ppl at CNN support the occupation (as seen by the one sided coverage and commentary), and that's why they canned him.

This is not rocket science.

Done with CNN: love Jewish ppl but don't believe in settlements/occupation/apartheid.

Providing even tacit support for Palestinian violence is anti-semitic.  Calling for justice from the "river to the sea" is a dog whistle to Palestinians.

Btw, when you choose to protest by kneeling during the national anthem you are being unpatriotic and showing a disdain for veterans who have given their lives for our country and protect it every day.

Many veterans completely disagrees with you.  In fact the person who advised Kaepernick to silently kneel is a veteran.  Why do you put the physical symbol above what it symbolizes?

Thank you! They care more about a piece of fabric than they do justice, equal rights, respect and love for your fellow man. Pathetic.

When you ignore international law and the basic humanity of others, people with sensibility will call it out. 

Israel literally has no excuse other than, 'if you single us out it's because antisemitism'.

But ppl always call out bigotry, Black Lives Matter does in the US, ppl protesting China's authoritarian regime do, Republicans calling out Russia* etc.

So now there's no room to denounce the apartheid-like policies of the Israeli occupation without being antisemitic?

He didn't denounce anything. He called for Palestinians to turn to terrorism, and murder innocent Jews in Israel, as a means of furthering their political agenda: HERE: Contrary to western mythology, black resistance to American apartheid did not come purely through Gandi and nonviolence, said Hill. If we are to operate in true solidarity with the Palestinian people, we must allow the Palestinian people the same range of opportunity and political possibility. If we are standing in solidarity with the Palestinian people, we must recognize the right of an occupied people to defend itself. We must prioritize peace, but we must not romanticize or fetishize it. We must advocate and promote nonviolence at every opportunity, but we cannot endorse a narrow politics of respectability that shames Palestinians for resisting, for refusing to do nothing in the face of state violence and ethnic cleansing, he added. Hill concluded his remarks by calling for a free Palestine, from the river to the sea.

There are no innocent Jews regarding the Palestinian situation unless there are actively protesting the mass incarceration of a nation of people.

So every Jew has to denounce Israel in order for you to consider them innocent? Sounds like the GOP's assessment of black people - they just love Clarence Thomas and Ben Carson. And you're every bit as racist as they are.

Whining for justice and equality for 2,000 years, as soon as they get their own country they adopt an apartheid. Just saying.

Actually that is not true. Jews, and I am one, have been persecuted and killed yes. For centuries. They never asked for equality as you note. Fact...the Inquisition, conversion by the sword, the expulsions, limitations on where one can live or work, the pogroms, Protocols of Zion culminating with the extermination of 6 million or more people.

You response does nothing to defend Israel putting up walls and practically imprisoning a people. It's pathetic that they learned nothing from how they were treated through out history.

The Palestinians were there LONG before a bunch of Europeans with questionable ties to Israel stole, and killed for that patch of land!

CNN is a joke. For all of the drama of Jim Acosta and his First Amendment battle with the Trump regime, they will turn around and fire anyone that conflicts with their gaslighting agenda. How else can you explain Santorum or the other Nazi sympathizing Trump goons that CNN regularly features as guest panelists.

Didn't we already have this dynamic opposing the Apartheid regime of South Africa? 

Interesting how it was the Israeli Government which CONTINUED it's support of the RACIST APARTHEID SOUTH AFRICAN REGIME while most nations divested their Interests forcing the rule of equality and democracy to be established in South Africa.

A very misleading headline.  Actually, he didn't just call for "equal rights."  He called for a "free Palestine from the river to the sea."  This is a slogan that began with the PLO several years before Israel even had any control over the currently disputed territories, and was meant to reject the very existence of Israel and any Jewish national home.  It later became a popular slogan among those who reject any compromise with Israel - including the terror group Hamas, which calls for the destruction of Israel.

unfortunately, he also suggested that Palestinians have a right to use violence against civilians to achieve their aims.

You must be delusional. The IDF just shot Palestinians today again over settlers stealing land again in Palestine. Try reading Haaretz .

Please do not resort to insults.  That's not helpful.  
And please read what I said.  His remarks were understood as calling for the destruction of Israel and condoning violence against civilians.  That is why he was fired.

You must know what happened again today. That is not an insult to remind you of it. And it is Israel who are eliminating all of Palestine and appropriating it for themselves. Ifamericansknew, you will see the amount of dead Palestine has, versus the amount of Israelis, the facts are that Palestine has not the means to hurt anyone, and Israel does and has, as was demonstrated again just today. Those settlers who harm Palestinians what do you call them ? And when they steal land, destroy crops and trees, and then the IDF comes and shoots Palestinians what do you call that  ? Justice ?
