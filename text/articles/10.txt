Golly, funny story - same exact thing happened back in 2012 or 13- and tear gas was used. Oddly, there was no outrage, no self righteous Horsey cartoon, no - oh that's right Obama was in office...

What is the difference between "just let them in" and "open borders"?

When people rush the border and try to force their past CBP, like they did to enter Mexico, what is a more humane way to stop them and control the border than to use tear gas to disperse them?

They are being allowed to make their asylum claims even though we know the vast majority will be denied by the courts. If history is a guide for every legitimate asylum claim 10 will be denied.

The least important aspect of this crisis is whether or not the term invasion is appropriate bu that is a great open borders talking point.See more...

There is absolutely no excuse for throwing rocks at law enforcement. These people have a strange way of garnering sympathy for their situation.

I'm generally compassionate toward those wanting a better life for their family. I get that.

But don't rush the border. Don't throw rocks. It pretty much confirms all the worst stereotypes about illegal immigrants. If this is how you behave, then why would we want you here?

None of these rock throwers are illegal immigrants. They are in Mexico and Mexico has granted them permission to be in Mexico.

According to the LA Times many of the people in the caravan entered Mexico illegally after throwing rocks at police and trying to storm the southern border of Mexico. Are these your rock-throwing friends?
Migrants keep moving north after melee at the Mexico-Guatemala border leaves one dead and dozens injured

And they're all going to be denied asylum in the US because Mexico already offered it to them. Asylum is supposed to be a way of escaping violence in one's home country -- The mere fact these people didn't accept it from Mexico proves their asylum claims are fabricated -- They're coming for work, which makes them illegal immigrants.

You don't know what you're talking about. Whether or not a migrant has been "offered" asylum by Mexico has no bearing whatsoever on whether or not the migrant can qualify for asylum in the US, should he or she have the opportunity to apply.
Avatar
Um, yes it does. Why do you think the asylum cases are heard by a judge? No court will grant asylum once it's known they turned it down in Mexico -- It exposes their real intentions, which is being caught, then released into the US, and then disappearing into our country and never showing up for their hearing. If you dispute that very obvious fact, you're just plain ignorant.

You have stated no facts. This is pure conjecture on your part. How would a US immigration judge know if a migrant had been "offered" asylum in Mexico. Do you think that Mexico's Gobernacin (Department of State responsible for immigration law) shares information about "offers" of asylum in Mexico with US immigration courts? Why should they. It's none of their business and not relevant to any individual's application for asylum in the US. And on what basis do you claim to know the "real intentions" of 6,000 migrants? Stop making things up to suit your anti-immigrant rhetoric.

This is EXACTLY what President Trump predicted would happen with this lawless bunch. They already tore down the border crossing gates between Guatemala and Mexico, so I don't know why anyone is surprised. And shame on the people trying to fly the "firing tear gas at children" banner -- the blame is on the people trying to rush the border. The United States has the right to defend its sovereign border against a lawless horde.

Just what we needed, more fresh meat for the White supremacists demanding swift, decisive, and violent action against these asylum seekers. Clearly, trump and his administration have learned that feeding their supporters' worst instincts is a very effective way to continue pleasing that base.

You mean that 38% of the nation who make up Trump's white nationalist base? The majority of us don't care what Trump's base is pleased about.

Yes, they are technically "Asylum Seekers", but that does NOT mean that they actually qualify for Asylum. 
Over 90% of Honduran asylum claims were REJECTED by the Obama Administration Immigration Judges.
These people are Economic Migrants and do NOT qualify for Asylum.

US taxpayers fund training, weapons and intelligence for Honduran police and military. Results are cities with the world's highest rape and murder cases. What's up with that?

Yeah, why did President Obama fund that program for 8 years?

Congress funds programs, not the Executive Branch.

The president* using this as evidence of his rhetoric regarding these asylum seekers is the equivalent of someone starting a house fire and using it as proof that the structure was insufficiently fireproofed.

When is the LA Times going to report on the 2,000 Haitian migrants that recently arrived in Tijuana and worked with the system in place there and found success?
Avatar
Never understood Mexico allowing caravan from south america like honduras, guatemala and so forth. Eventually when they settle down here, the remittances are going to Honduras and Guatemala. It will hit mexico in their pocket book in the long run

Shooting tear gas at kids. Shooting tear gas at parents trying to save their kids from violence and economic destitution caused at least in significant part by US policies. What a pathetic, know-nothing response.
Avatar
Please, police have no problems shooting tear gas at US kids, what in the heck makes these people special? Police have no problems killing unarmed kids and people. I guess you missed the LA Times article yesterday about the kids who are experiencing violence an economic destitution here in the US. You might want to go back and read that. 

The bottom line is these "migrant" parents (and I am using that term very loosely) need to be charged with child abuse and endangerment. Maybe we should take a few of these "migrants" and their "kids" to Yemen, Syria, or the refugee camps in Jordan and Turkey. Then they can see just how good they have it "back home". Or maybe we make them all go to the Southside of Chicago or to Baltimore. The kids living in these cities need asylum too from the bullet, death and violence in addition to the poverty and homelessness.See more...

They should NOT rush our border! That is lawless. Shame on you for acting as if the country defending its border is in the wrong.
Avatar
Yea, right. The US military defending our border against unarmed civilians seeking asylum from violence and corruption in their own country. What a pretty picture of how Trump and his supporters are MAGA.
Avatar
You don't even know how US asylum laws work, do you? If "violence and corruption in their own country" was their motivation for leaving, they would've accepted Mexico's asylum offer. They're sole intention here is getting to the US for work, and that's unlawful.

What solution do you propose as an alternative to securing our border?

Using children as pawns in order to gain entry into a country that doesn't want them. What a pathetic, 
know- nothing response.

I am beginning to think that these people are fleeing prosecution rather than persecution. Thank you, Mexico, for deporting more & more of them each day.
