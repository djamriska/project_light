It's pretty bad when you can't even pay them extra to do their job. I bet the illegal is still here.

It is not the fault of ICE that the parents made stupid choices.

He knew she and the daughter were illegal aliens, that makes him an accessory to a misdominor.  He tried to bribe a federal officer that makes him a felon.  Have fun in jail criminal.

C'mom.  ICE should have paid the husband for reporting the wife and her kid were illegals. This is not right.  Guess "No good deed goes unpunished" once again.

ICE guys deport them for free, don't they ?  Good man to want to deport an illegal, but if she was so bad, he had to pay for it, Geesh, that is a nightmare.

"On June 6, they arranged to meet in person, during which Burgos offered $4,000 to deport his wife and her child. He was arrested on June 29."

From the story there was more than enough evidence to take to court, yet wait another 3 weeks to arrest?

If an agent refuses your bribe, then calls you back a couple of days later to "talk" more about the bribe.....you are being set-up genius...

If you get divorced, then just let them go.  Do not act like a vindictive bit**.

She probably wanted support money from him, so the easiest way to squash that is to make her a "no show" at the divorce hearings.

No way to know.  But even if true, then this guy should have manned up.  Marriage is a gamble.  And when you lose a bet, you pay.

There's a little more detail in the press release. They met in El Salvador, so he no doubt sponsored her and her child to immigrate into the US with a K1 visa. It's a sleazy way for him to get out of it, I agree.

Seems he swapped a life sentence for a 15 year one!!!  Regardless of language, some you just can't stand to live with. NOW, what ever happened to the ICE agent reported as sneaking in illegals earlier? .
