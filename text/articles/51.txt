He actually means everyone else's boys should be trained to rush shooters!

His own grandchildren... not so much.

Its a good idea. Start the training with the Trump boys and the sons of supporting evangelicals.

Not a single mass shooter has been a member of the NRA.  They are more likely to be left winged social justice warriors.

Why just the boys? Why not the girls? I have three daughters. Are they just supposed to sit around like sacrificial lambs waiting to be slaughtered by a bad guy with gun, or rescued by a  good guy with a gun both in a haze of toxic masculinity? I dont think so! When you hear that phrase, this is exactly the kind of hyper masculine stupidity they are talking about. Instead of training our boys to be heros lets start teaching conflict management in schools and police academies across the country, and support some reasonable gun control legislation! This NRATV nonsense makes my blood boil!

How about you tell us how? The recent mass shooters all passed backround checks and had legal weapons.

And had guns and multiple rounds of ammunition.  So to answer your question, ban them.. See Japan, Great Britain, Australia, Canada........

You just keep advocating for tougher guns laws. Yes, lets make it harder for people with a mental illness to obtain any form of firearm. Good to see you coming around genius.

Ahhh, a fellow Mensan replies! Glad you've recognized my genius. Let's see, hmmm. Only a tiny fraction of the mentally ill initiate violence. So, should your Aunt Milly who is under treatment for mild depression be denied a gun for self defense? Should those with Social Phobia? How about under treatment for mild anxiety?  

Since psychiatrists can't yet predict who will turn homicidal, whether or not they are mentally ill, how do we make a determination as to who gets guns?

The standard now is if a person has been incarcerated against their will due to being a danger to themselves or others. Is this good enough?

That's exactly what the boys did 100 years ago in Europe.

Most of them died........

It was a terrible plan then...and it's even worse now.

The NRA, distorted religion, and Trump nepotism.

That's rabid Nationalism for you.  It wasn't just what German boys were indoctrinated to do from school age on, but also the Japanese.

Hey, while we're at it, let's also start feeding them amphetamines as were the German &  Japanese troops to keep them hopped up & pliable. /s

Does anyone on the political right understand that children are, well, children.   Parents and government should be PROTECTING children.  Children should not be psychologically traumatized as a matter of policy. 

Ugh.  Between this, the continued refusal to do anything about mass shootings, the reprehensible abuse of police officers in schools, the separating of children at the border and most recently the tear gas, I'm beginning to think that the political right is engaging in a slow form of genocide on the next generation of children.

When Caucasian children's parents bum rush the border fence in Mexico, they'll all be gassed, too. Equal Opportunity Gassing.

Nice compassion. It's unfortunate you can't put yourself in their shoes. I blame your parents. Epic fail.

You're right. Kids today don't have the guts to charge a shooter; I agree.

Well Chuck, you and your NRA conspirators go right ahead and train your boys to run toward the gun. Hey I give you permission to use Run Toward the Gun!  as your slogan. Meanwhile sane, competent parents will use common sense to train their kids on how to survive mass shootings. And We will continue to fight for a ban on the sale of assault rifles!

Nothing like banning something when their already 10 million on the street. And you're gonna 'train" yiur kids how not to get shot? How would that be? Let them take pistols to school in their lunch boxes?

No, they should be trained to add steel plates to all their classroom doors as a shop project. That way, doors can be locked in a shooting event and can't be shot open. 

Ditto for the main school entrances. And add an armed trained cops at every entrance.

Increase your property taxes to pay for all this until the current "fad" of shooting up schools declines.

Hey Chuck, come to my classroom, tell the students what to do.  Also take a the, "how to stop bleeding" workshop with your co-workers. Anytime Chuck.

Just like their hero, Trump - who said he'd run into a school..... if he had been there.  Kind of like the time he ran to join the army when his number came up, but couldn't because he had um, , , , "bone spurs".  Instead, someone else got to go and serve in his place.
