I'd say that's worth killing over...no sense in two 20 year old's having a job or anything to do but play games......just hope they went to school long enough to learn what the word Sodomy means...their gonna learn real soon!!!!!!!!!

See, this is why I like my house, put everything in there that I need (except the occasional trip to the beer store) and try not to leave if I don't have to.  I have 400+ acres, shooting range, kegerator, sleds and 4x4s.  why would I ever leave?

Who said he stole it in the first place. They had a break in and they believed he was the one that stole it. What are they going to do when later down the line they find out it was the 16 year old kid down the street that really did it. Is a playstation worth a persons life?

Well, it's a he said, he said - he said nothing.

If they find out later that it wasn't him; Hmmmm, the same thing as if it was him....spend some time in jail.

You look at it as "is a PS worth a person's life?"  I look at it as "is your life worth a PS?"

I'm not justifying what these two losers did and have no idea if they targeted the right guy or not.  Hopefully a good investigation will reveal that they did indeed get the right guy.

Premeditated murder in the first degree.  Death sentence called for if convicted.

Stealing a Playstation from basement dwellers is like stealing a crack head's stash.  Very risky.

They need to hold the person who sold them the chef's knife accountable.

If he did indeed steal the PS, he'll never steal anything else and I'm okay with that.  It looks and sounds like the whole lot are a bunch of losers, except for the new roommate.

Hahahahahaha! Love that nobody's commenting on how disgusting the victim/thief is.... he got what was coming to him. Dont break in to someone's house and steal their stuff..... Calling the cops doesnt help. They very rarely ever recover stolen items... maybe a butcher's knife was a little much. Kicking his teeth in would have been better.

Wait til they find out the joysticks in prison differ from the ones they're used to.
