With you on this! I have no problem with people protesting by taking a knee during anthem.  I hope all of us have a big problem with people killing other people for no reason.

I notice you never even mentioned the innocent man shot by the police while doing his job. I guess an innocent Black man is still guilty in your eyes.

Disgusting.  You can bet that if the security guard had been white he would still be walking around today.  Sounds like murder to me.

Where is the outrage from white community organizers, like Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity?  Where is the outrage from the WhiteOnly NRA?  Where is the outrage from the WhitesOnly President Trump?

They are waiting until police finish investigating Roberson's home.  He might have paraphernalia and 1.7 grams of weed on his coffee table... which, as you know, changes EVERYTHING.

Well 62% of white America that votes, vote Republican. So it makes you wonder how much more of the non voting population feels this way. I know, I know.. all republicans aren't racist but.... if you're republican your probably a racist.

So the police took Dylan Roof, Robert Bowers and Gregory Bush live - all who were armed and just mass murdered people and then they murder this hero.  No words.

Exactly.  And they better not release any blood evidence that he had trace amounts of pot in his blood or some garbage like that.

A black man will never be seen as "a good guy with a gun" Our implicit bias against black Americans just won't allow it. This turns my stomach.

A Midlothian officer encountered a subject with a gun and was involved in an officer-involved shooting.

It will be interesting to see if more knees are taken on the football field during the coming weeks; this is a good opportunity.

Nothing new... shoot first, ask questions later.  Watch for the Union President to defend the "Officer's" actions.

an you wonder Why NFL players take a Knee in hopes of drawing attention to black shootings by Cops? If that Security Guard was a Hero he would know be getting Decorated by Trump on Stage! While trump says: See if Security has Guns they can stop shooters in their Tracks: How did that work out for you all?
