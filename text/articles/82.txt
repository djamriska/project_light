If it helps, I don't consider Trump a New Yorker as much as a Floridian, since he seems to spend most of his time at Mar-a-Lago.

I'm willing to bet anything that with facial recognition software they can find a picture of him at a trump rally (just like the "MAGA bomber".)

Just another fine young white male trying to keep from getting overrun by immigrants. My gender is just full of genetically disposable outcomes that should have been either at the end of a rubber or aborted outright.

Incels are those men who would not have mated in a natural environment.  Their genes would not have reproduced.  That may not be 100% accurate, but it certainly explains why they aren't able to attract partners.

I know.  And I'm tripping over it.  So what happens when we die again?  I work pretty hard at being a good guy!  And some people I know definitely don't!

Know better than what? To assume all conservative men never have consensual sex?

You challenged the internet to "name one guy from the right who has ever had consensual sex." I answered with two examples. I have plenty more examples, but I'm not going to waste my time proving your dumb point wrong.

Now you're probably mad because you're realizing how stupid you look for calling about half the men in the country rapists.
