His point is clear: that because he had one hit, people attributed his face tattoos to artistic genuis instead of mental instability which might have been an indicator of anti social tendencies. What was your point?

He looks like the love child of the Wendy's girl and the surface of a high school detention hall's desk...

Another rap role model working on his street cred. New step prison then getting Jesus and finally release and work on the Christian revival circuit with the rest of the talentless wash ups.

I was born in 1935 and was a teenager in the 1950s  ..... we had beautiful romantic music ...... good movies, good Presidents (FDR, IKE, TRUMAN) where did this stuff come from and why does anyone listen to it ????
    Society has come down a long way in EVERYTHING...... music ... movies ..... television ... politics and pretty much everything else 
    I just wonder how much farther down it can go until it EXPLODES ???????

And right there you are wrong. The 50's still had the big bands that their parents grew up listening to at the ballrooms (pre-radio) and at country hoedowns. The old-timer has a valid point. Heck, I grew up in the 70's and I don't get the hard edged music of today either.

wasted talent because he confuses "coolness" and being a badass, not as sophisticated hipness, but as being a criminal...

When he gets out of prison he can start a new band. I suggest he call it "The Useless Tattoos"

And yet he looks so well put together and reasonable, like a guy that makes very well thought out choices.

Lesson of the day kids: be careful what you put out into the universe. Things tend to boomerang right back at you.

Nothing against tattoos, but I don`t like them against my skin. Not one, at 54, and so proud. I like the goal of getting through life, with my skin the way it was when I was born.

You can always recognize the classy people who dedicate themselves to making our world a better place. Theyre the ones with a lengthy rap sheet, clueless expression and tattoos on the face.
