This seems in bad taste, just now, and I hate to mention it, but it seems necessary for someone to point out that the 'good guys with a gun' haven't been doing very well against the 'bad guys with a gun.' 
Perhaps that idea's flawed, and should be abandoned.

Considering that the one good guy at a Chicago club was murdered by law enforcement while clearly doing his job Id have to agree.

The idea is flawed regardless because it ignores what happens before 'good gun' meets 'bad gun'. So it's always going to be 'good gun' stopped 'bad gun' after X amount of victims had been killed by it... the maths never makes it up.

Yes, but, it is, after all, their fantasy and in it the 'good guy' will always be on the scene to catch and stop the 'bad guy' as soon as the gun comes out and before anyone is hurt. 
That's the nice thing about fantasies.

Our so called leader attacking the integrity of an honorable member of the military (who happened to be part of the team who killed Obama bin Laden) and yet ANOTHER senseless shooting - this time at a Chicago hospital. Just another typical week in this nation. And its only Monday!

Senseless?  Are there shootings that make sense?

People won't answer that because they don't want the cops to knock on their front door at 4AM.

Is this another example of a law abiding responsible citizen with a gun.  Or another example of why some people should not own or have access to a gun?

Kind of obvious that about 39% of the country should be evaluated to determine if they have the mental stability to own a firearm.

Note the limited response by politicians now that "thoughts and prayers" are no longer adequate.

How tragic
People going about their daily lives and needlessly  die. Getting off an elevator???
I can understand why police officers have trepidation in responding to domestic situations ( as this started out). Emotions are running high, anything can happen, can turn deadly within seconds.
And, could happen anywhere

Strict national gun control laws work in every other modern industrialized countries and it can work in the US as well.  We know this is true because states with stricter gun control laws have less shootings.

chicago has had some of the strictest gun control laws in the country, and yet they seem to have so many shootings. What makes liberals think making more gun laws would work?

Yet again I will opine my "extreme position," and with less and less apology and justification as we (the Nation & people) continue to die on the wrong end of a gun:  NO MORE GUNS...eliminate them ALL, and make them illegal except for the Armed Forces.

I guess the cure for this outrageous act on innocents is to have doctors and nurses carry guns instead of stethoscopes.

Finally HuffPost is acknowledging that this happened ... many hours after the fact. Better late than never, I guess.

Sharon Bakula, the shooting occurred at nearly 4pm.  The article was published at 9... that's about the right time for the reporters to get all of the relevant information and verify the accuracy.  What exactly did you expect?  A simple headline with situation developing comment?

How about the dozens of other shootings in the Chicago area that happen on a week in - week out basis that you and other media sites fail to report on?  To Chicagoans this is probably just another day.

They have gun violence in Chicago on a regular basis, but how can that be? A democrat stronghold with some of the strictest gun laws in the country has gun violence regularly? Maybe they should consider nukes in response, I'm sure Rep. Swalwell would be willing to consider it.

Maybe you can tell us how the current gun laws in the country are doing a single thing to assure they're providing for a 'well regulated militia.'
That's the only reason for providing the right, and militias haven't been in use much since the Civil War.

What does the 2nd Amendment have to do with a skumbag being a skumbag? It's a people problem, because just like those gun laws didn't stop him neither did the laws against murder and attempting murder
