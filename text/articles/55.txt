Then what about all the texts, Kate, where you plainly admit what you are doing.  Don't blame you for trying out this defense, but come on, really?

A homeless giving his last $20 to a perfect stranger woman who was stranded with no gas in her car. She couldnt call AAA, call her boyfriend, a friend/family member, or even a Uber. Yep, that story was fishy from the very beginning...

I do not think that will work with the jury, her, boyfriend and the homeless fellow all perpetrated a felony fraud, theft by deception of more than $200 is a felony! Send them to prison, take ever dime, piece of property they own or have moved to relatives, if relatives took the money, items knowingly a crime was committed then charge them too as co-conspirators, either way take the ill-gotten gains from them and return them to the victims those duped by fraud on go-fund me!

It is amazing how much people suddenly realize AFTER they're caught.
