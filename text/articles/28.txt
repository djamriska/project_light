Yes, anyone who believes in imaginary beings isn't mentally stable.

That's not true.  They come in all ages, races and genders.  
Your statements are so boring and easy to dispel.

Don't take it so personal. Most crimes come out of poverty, poor education, unemployment, mental health issues and poor upbringing regardless of age, race and gender. With males in majority, probably due to testosterone. But, the white, christian pervs they stand out somehow.

We can break down crimes by race if you want to.

We can use FBI data.

He sure is, but let's not make the foolish mistake of attributing the evil of men to Him. That's a slippery slope you don't want to go down.

Execute this Man, his Parents, and his siblings. It's not worth risking another innocent child to any family with a Mental Defect.

You're either as bad or worse than him.

A guy who has never hurt anyone is worse than a guy who molests a 3 year old?  You must be a Democrat or a Christian.

If you really believe  it's right to execute the parents and siblings of a criminal then I truly believe YOU have a Mental Defect.

Wait....if there aren't  cameras in the bathrooms, how the heck was he caught? Was he truly stupid enough to molest a child with the door opened? I am a fairly intelligent person, however I have to admit to some confusion here. Having said that, I hope he has a good time in prison...he won't be able to sit down for a looooong time.

Maybe sub-consciously he wanted to be caught, who knows what going on in these peoples minds.

Something is fishy here.  No cameras in the bathroom, but the guy left the door open while molesting a 3 y/o so a hall camera could catch him?

For those who are bringing politics into this situation, blaming a party and what not, you clearly don't care about the situation that happened. You don't care about the future mental effects of this three year old. You're garbage. Please don't vote anymore, you have no morals, you're probably going to catch the world on fire with your ignorant mindset.

If Hazlett had been a Catholic priest, the church's defense would be the boy was possessed by satan and tempted the innocent "holy man."

Hazlett failed in his application to be a Catholic priest. He got caught.

If this guy did it he needs help or permanent incarceration.  If he didn't and someone is setting him up they need to be punished.  It sounds kind of weird that there was no camera's in the bathroom just one in the hall that MAY have picked it up?

I didn't mean it was weird that there was no cameras in the bathroom just that it was weird that it would be picked up by a camera in the hall.
