Was the argument about Heinz vs Hunt's? This could get ugly.

Hunt's doesn't even qualify as actual ketchup...don't get me started on Del Monte.

You obviously haven't been to GOP states. Big fat , GOP women still styling their hair as if it's 1988, with rear ends the size of a barn.

I guess it's just too much country fried chicken, and too much pecan pie.

Some people get offended at the
silliest things, and get violent and
defensive. Watch out.

Agreed. Why would anyone get upset that people sneak into their country and write on their walls and drive their property values down? Just keep raising fees/taxes on everyone to pay for these wonderful people. Now why would anyone take offense to that?

Two positives I see here: 
1. Future potential employers will see this. 
2. Future male suitors will see this.

People wonder why the nanny state is increasing it's power. This is why. Permissive parents who abide by stupid teevee programs to learn how to handle children, self esteem programs in schools, stuck up entertainment stars who act like babies being embellished and treated as gods, same for useless politicians abolition of individual responsibility.The same moral decay that brought down the Roman Empire.

Enjoy the last remnants of strength and liberty in America while you can.

Peter, right subject, wrong article for it. It's MUCH more likely that this crazy chick is a gang member (& probably a druggie) and is therefore used to getting her way with the threat of violence. Spoiled kids who watch too much TV don't go apesh!t over not getting enough ketchup. Try to keep up.

Not a gang member.

If she was a gang member, the mcdonnells worker would have been picking up all her teeth on the floor or her brains.

Youre right. Because most gang members are BIack or Hlspanlcs, they are inherently more violent. And more likely to be arrested for homicide.

I LOVE when dumb Progressives prove me right!
