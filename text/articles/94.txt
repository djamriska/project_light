He knows, he just doesn't care. His allegiance is only to himself.

You are delusional. What did owebama ever do except divide, apologize, talk America down, destroy the economy, heighten racism and double the national debt?

Im confused. They caught the Russians in a parking lot in The Hague with their surveillance gear in full display. They even tried to destroy their phones. Were they arrested?  Sent home?  I know the phones and laptops had a treasure trove of information.

The Russian hackers could have obtain the same information with Lavrov & Kislyak going to the Oval office and talking with Moscow Donnie (aka David Dennison).  Afterwards they could pose for another picture with them laughing together.

Wait, he said we where safe and he said we were tough on Russia? No, it is the Chinese!no, it is the Dems, they did it. No, it is the Dutch, they made it all up. No way Putin did this, just fake news. It is just like the non-fake President we now have.

The russians are not so bad,  Putin is my friend. What he ordered this botched job and tried to assassinate people in Britain. Inconceivable

Still cant stop that third world country from doing this? The US is gigantically responsible for the technology, yet stopping these drunks is difficult?

Colossal waste of time. Will any of the 7 be extradited? Show up in American courts? LOL

There's no expectation that the indicted Russians will be captured and put into US prisons, though if they're not careful in their travels, that could happen. Indictments like these are intended, among other reasons, to show justification for sanctions against these people, which can cause problems for them no matter where they are, and the people they work for in the Russian government, and to lay the groundwork for future investigation of and indictments against the broader network of criminals, some of which might be apprehendable.

Aside from the indictments, the investigations that led to them help the US figure out and hopefully plug some of the methods by which these attacks are carried out.

So all that time wasted charging 7 people in Russia who won't be extradicted or actually be here to face any charges.

Shouldn't investigate attacks on our country if we can't prosecute the offenders.  Just let them have at it.   Got it.

Time that could disappear for individuals if these systems were to fail.
Not a waste of time, preventing the interruption of it.
