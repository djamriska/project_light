Looks like the new "tradition" will be registering as a sex offender for life and avoiding parental asset forfeiture. Go Team!

This story is funny.
Cos in Australia our hazing wasnt to such profane things. I mean most we did was shaved our mates with a reverse moehawk or bald and shaved their eyebrows when they passed out drunk.

I blame coaches and the entire high school football frenzy with crazy parents included. This stuff has gone on for decades in high school football. Our children who want to participate in sports should not ever have to be exposed to this violence.

They ARE the first line to turn their eyes away from these 'pranks' and then say they didn't know when someone gets hurt or dies.  It's wrong, it's unnecessary and it needs to stop!

Maybe shutting down this school's football program for 10 years will get the attention of the parents of the kids in this school.

Adult crime deserves adult punishment.  15 year olds know what they were doing was wrong.

Every last asset and penny their parents possess should be forfeited. My son played HS football and while far from a "super mom" I didn't raise a monster. Sentence them as adults, and sue the parents for everything, down to the dirty socks in their hampers.

As long as I live I will never understand things like this. What is going on in the head of someone who would commit this type of violent attack.

Being told you face charges where you could go to jail for the rest of your life is pretty darn intimidating.  No, nope, NO. Intimidating is being sodomized in the dark you clueless dunce.

That is so horrible.  In the crazy mad rush to have your kids excel at sports parents appear to have forgotten to teach morals, kindness, courtesy, respect, etc.  One wonders is sports more important than morals.

Sadly, these boys deserve everything that will befall them.  Their victims will bear the scars of this painful betrayal for the rest of their lives.  There is no compensation for them.  In some sense the perpetrators are victims themselves of a sick culture that could condone and pass on such a perverse ritual.  Shame on them, their parents and those that came before them.  I hope that more victims will come forward to name their tormentors from the past.

Yeah, this isn't "Hazing" or "Bullying", this is sexual assault, male on male rape.

Suing only brings some financial benefit but some of these boys will carry this emotionally for the rest of their lives.  This will be in their memories forever.  They will struggle with feeling used, like trash, being abuse, feeling inadequate and a host of other psychological issues that most will not see or think about or write off as something they need to deal with.  These are serious, very serious, 'pranks' that must stop!

Sounds like prison.  That could cause serious health problems or death.  Would anyone blame a parent of a victim who killed one of these abusers?

High school football is just another word for traumatic brain injury. Its not academic and wastes scarce education money. Get rid of it.

It is very disturbing. Do I blame those who made a conscious decision to assault another person... DAMN RIGHT I DO! 
But I have to wonder what is going to happen to those who went before. We have to remember that the perpetrator said "It's tradition".
What has the school done... what is it planning to do to STOP this disgusting "tradition"

Projection by Reel from the time when he was a high school football player? The level of his condescension certainly suggests deep-seated insecurities, as does his fascination with name-calling labels. Could be another stable genius...?
