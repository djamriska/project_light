Pure evil. I'm sure he'll get sympathy for being a "poor kid suffering with mental illness" on account he's... Y'know(wink, wink)... from Laguna but he's a monster. Can't imagine how his mom feels losing her husband and son like that.

You know, for all the talk about crime in South-Central and Santa Ana, the rich folks in the Capistrano Valley (Mission Veijo, Laguna Niguel) over the past 10 years seem to be much more brutal, especially with their own family members.
