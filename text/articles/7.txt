I have always been grateful to my parents for not naming me Jack.

As a teacher, I despise parents who wreck their kids' lives and CREATE permanent ridicule by giving them NOT A NAME---this isn't EVEN a name---but a verbal noose around their neck that will ruin every attempt they ever make to introduce or identify themselves in this world. WE NEED LAWS AGAINST THIS ABUSE.

Why in the WORLD would parents do something like this to their kids? You are making life many times more hard for them then it has to be.

This is simply a stupid parent lashing out at others; realizing what a huge mistake she made. Take responsibility - and don't name your kids while dropping acid.

This mother is dreaming if the name she gave her daughter is not open to public ridicule. 

Just like she is free to name her daughter a made up name, people are open to mock the name itself.

Wow. So name your daughter in such a way that she'll have people always look at it oddly.

What the employee did was wrong, but the parents have also destined their child to a lifetime of teachers and everyone else pausing when they see the name, struggling to read it and be polite and respectful, not to mention those who will not be respectful.

1; that mother knew WTH she was doing and sounds like she was asking for people to comment on her "Special daughter". 2; the daughter may have a special name, but what does the addition of mentioning her epilepsy have anything to do with this article. The girl was not having an epileptic episode or a seizure, she was not noticably sick or anything.absolutely pointless. terrible people all around.

I really thought there would be more comments questioning the wisdom of the mother for coming up with a name just asking for ridicule. We all have to live with the name given to us by our parents. This little girl deserved better.
