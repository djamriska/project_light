Sorry but our immediate threat to us is the gang problem already here and has been here for decades. Get the guard after them, raid their homes or whatever and charge them with the ricoh act. These are home grown terrorists, i do not care what color they are either.

If you don't care about color why did you immediately associate the fact that the victims are black with a "gang problem"?

Hope street is in Kensington. An area with high gang violence so the chances are pretty good.

Cant go trick or treating without getting shot. Cant worship in church or Temple without getting shot. Cant do yoga without getting shot. Cant go to school without getting shot. Cant go shopping without getting shot. Im starting to see a pattern here.

This is sad, but when my kids were that age, 25 years ago, we had to check all their candy for pins and razor blades, and nutcases were putting poison in Tylenol bottles. So hate has always been with us.

Nice story,,,MARSHFIELD, Mass. 
Marshfield police are warning residents to inspect their childrens Halloween candy after needles were found in packages of Twizzlers.
Police said Thursday that sewing needles were found in two separate packages of Twizzlers twists that were given to a 3-year-old boy.

It is old hat but let me repeat it again. There are too many guns in the hands of criminals. The only unfortunate way to solve this is by taking the guns away from everyone.  There is really no other solution. If there is I like to hear it. Thank you.

Right Wing Solution: Have armed guards at every home throughout the city.

Guns, poverty, and education limits are what causes this. Until Americans fix these easily fixable problems this will continue to happen. Poverty and low education are the two things religions need to survive so look at these problems and realise the reason why separation of Church and state is so important. If the advocates for having religion  are in charge you get Betsy Devos and Steve Minuchin, then the USA becomes the Christian version of the middle-east and you see how under developed their infrastructure is and how few rights they have, especially the women.

Spraying a street with bullets and hitting kids should be illegal.

When Moses wrote the Constitution, he said, "God gave us the right to fire at will".  Ask a Texas school board member.

You must be a bot because your last post conflicts with your first post, unless, of course, your first post was sarcastic, then both would make perfect sense (German bombing reference is slightly amusing) but youre still a bot.

Somebody needs to explain how two men getting out of the same car and shooting the kids is considered "crossfire".  If the two men were shooting at each other, and the kids were shot, that would be crossfire.  Crossfire implies you are not the target, yet it seems these kids were the target.

The men were not shooting at each other; they were shooting at someone in the street who was in the line of fire beyond the children.

Thanks.  I read the article again.  It also said that reporters found shell casings, which implies the reporters got there before the police.  I hope they were smart reporters.

Cops are only in a hurry when some white lady is calling the cops on black people for doing something normal in public.

Where did this poster mention the shooters or gangs as being black?  She stated that she did not care what color they were.

Caught in the crossfire? Who were they shooting at? My sad assumption is that it was Proud Boys shooting at children for being black and there is nothing in the story to contradict that.

That is a pretty sad assumption. How many people have been gunned down in the streets, by "The Proud Boys"? Now how many people have been gunned down in the street, by inner city gangs, in Philadelphia alone? It's not about race, there are gangs and gang members of ever race.

Can you imagine what childhood is going to be like, now that children have been the targeted victims of a shooting, while they were Trick-or-Treating? 
Children will not get to experience the joy of getting candy treats from their neighbours while experiencing the anonymity of wearing costumes! 

This is going to affect many children in the Philadelphia area, and only for ill reasons. Children getting shot is never a good thing, but getting shot on Halloween is just about the worst time imaginable! And now it's going to be doubly worse because parents, in a pique of over-caution are not going to let their children go trick-or-treating by themselves anymore.
