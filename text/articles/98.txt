She actually is quite pale, and therefore appears to me to be a zombie.

Accordingly I should be allowed to bash her brains in with a baseball bat.

This is exactly why rapes go unreported. Shameful.

If you were the attorney you would use anything you have or find. I say let the juror do their job.

A witness saw his hand on the teen's throat... so a virgin consented to sex in front of other people? And the accused knew what her underwear looked like under her clothes? Or in order to not consent to sex, women must wear granny undies? Or maybe burkas Ireland? This is just so f---d up on so many levels. Between your archaic abortion laws and this crup, scratching Ireland off my bucket list.

How about letting the juror think for themselves?

So now the manufacturer and retailers of these thongs can be taken to court and sued for making and selling rape consent garments, right?

Why do you need a daughter to be incensed? Isnt rape, assault, or violence against ANY woman reason enough?

If they get raped in those countries they are thrown in prison or even stoned.

Come on, this is just the argument of the defense, is not a law!

You have to look at the way she was dressed, Well, the only way you can make that judgement is to strip her down to her underwear!!!! The judiciary should be removed. If it was HIS daughter I bet that the result would be different!!!!

Do you understand this is the argument of the defense? The jury will take their decision. Do you want to repress the attorneys doing their job? If you were a suspect I bet you'd think your attorney must do his best to help you.

I feel very badly for this woman, as it seems she got no justice. 95% of the time, rape accusers are truthful. The fact that her underwear were shown in court just makes me sick! #BelieveWomen

Did she use her underwear to tie herself up?

women's clothing according to a woman's brain are not enticements to rape.  It's ludicrous that there are males on this planet that still infer "if she wasn't dressed that way, she wouldn't have been raped".  Rapists are degenerate, violent, sociopathic psychopaths.  When will men realize they can't abuse a woman because of how she's dressed.  What if the tide was reversed.  Every time a woman saw a man in an outfit they liked, they accosted that man, probably with help from another person to subdue the man, and tied him up and raped him with objects, sodomized him, totally abused his body in any way they could?  Would men be so keen on telling women they shouldn't dress provacatively so they don't get raped?  Think about that scenario.  So it's clear, that is not my scenario, nor do I advocate such conduct.    I'm just making a point.

I agree with most of what you wrote, but I think there's a big difference. I know many males who wouldn't have any major problem if the any women accosted them and used him to have sex. They'd just ask How do I have to dress?  Unless we understand this situation we're going to have a lot of misunderstandings. We see things different and it's almost totalitarian the way some feminists want the things to roll. Now, let's say that's not my scenario nor do I advocate such conduct. I'm too, just making a point.

Normal decent virtuous men never rape  or abuse or enslave  another person REGARDLESS of the times, what other  "leaders" are doing, or whether the clothing is enticing......  That your grandfather, the airman ,went to strip clubs doesn't speak  highly of him his friends or your family!
