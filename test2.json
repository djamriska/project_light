	"SourceID": "OCR",
	"ArticleContent": "The Woolsey fire that burned 83,275 acres in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, claimed two lives and injured three firefighters was declared 10 percent contained on Sunday morning as firefighters said rising Santa Ana winds present new threats. Officials urged residents to evacuate, especially in the Topanga Canyon area, while a Malibu city councilman who lost his home was reported injured and being treated in an intensive care unit, according to a fellow council member.  The only thing we’re not concerned about is the ocean,  Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl L. Osby said at a morning news conference -We have 10 percent containment, which means we have 90 percent open line,Osby said. We have a lot of hot spots within the incident. Osby said the Santa Ana winds were expected to peak at 40 mph in the fire area, and last for three days. Firefighters said the winds could make drops from air tankers and helicopters less effective. And even as officials spoke at the news conference, there was a wind-driven flare-up in West Hills, sparking spot fires in the area of Arminta Street. Firefighters jumped into fire-protection mode, and aerial drops began, even dropping on firefighters who were working in backyards of homes in the area. ",
